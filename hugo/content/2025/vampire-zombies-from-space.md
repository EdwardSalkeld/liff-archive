title = "Vampire Zombies from Space"
+++
A loving spoof of 1950s drive-in creature features, packed with laughs, gore and lots of cigarettes.
The quiet town of Marlow is under siege from creatures that come from space and want to suck your blood, led by Dracula himself. With bloodsuckers and zombies multiplying fast, a grizzled detective, a chain-smoking greaser and a plucky young woman must join forces to save the town. Wild, silly and uncannily faithful to B-movie cinema, this is a parody that revels in its love of schlocky horror.

Contains scenes of strong violence and gore.
