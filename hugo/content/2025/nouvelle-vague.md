In his much-anticipated latest feature, indie auteur Richard Linklater crafts a stylish, black-and-white homage to the French New Wave. 

Set across the streets of Paris, it follows the chaotic making of the legendary 1960 film Breathless. Newcomer Guillaume Marbeck, shines as Jean-Luc Godard, directing Jean Seberg (Zoey Deutch) and Jean-Paul Belmondo (Aubry Dullin) amid growing pressures from producers. A nostalgic feast for cinephiles and lovers of film history. 


Contains themes of sexism.
