Werner Herzog returns with Ghost Elephants, an enthralling journey into the misty Angolan highlands. 
Joining eccentric conservationist Dr Steve Boyes and master Namibian trackers, Herzog searches for a mythical herd of giant elephants, colossal creatures that exist between science and legend. With dazzling cinematography and Herzog’s singular narration, the film becomes a poetic meditation on obsession, vanishing cultures, and the enduring mysteries of nature.
