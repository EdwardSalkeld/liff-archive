The great Paolo Sorrentino’s latest film reunites him with his favourite leading actor Toni Servillo (The Great Beauty, Il Divo), who gives a sublime performance as a fictional Italian president. 

The ageing leader has to reckon with political dilemmas, moral quandaries and ghosts from his past as his term draws to a close. Made with baroque flourishes of his trademark visual style but also a newfound elegant restraint, Sorrentino’s film achieves a real depth and emotional resonance.
