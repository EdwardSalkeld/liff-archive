Our Land interrogates the connections between land, power and a sense of belonging following the Right to Roam movement in Engand and Wales now it's gaining real traction.
We hear from both sides of the divide. Director Orban Wallace gives space for some of the landowners of large estates to offer their perspectives, which are more diverse than you might think. And it witnesses organised mass trespass events led by activists who question the 92% of English land which lacks legal public access.
