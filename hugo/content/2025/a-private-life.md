Jodie Foster shines in her first French-speaking lead role in Rebecca Zlotowski’s playful murder mystery.
Foster stars as Lilian Steiner, an American psychoanalyst in Paris whose life is upended after the sudden death of a long-standing patient. Convinced it was murder, Lilian throws herself into some amateur sleuthing, with her ex-husband (Daniel Auteuil) in tow. An elegant, unpredictable thriller laced with dark humour and Hitchcockian flair, A Private Life is a hugely entertaining delight.

Contains themes of suicide.
