From director Yugo Sakamoto (Baby Assassins) and adapted from Masakazu Ishiguro’s manga, Nemurubaka: Hypnic Jerks is a comic story about the everyday life of two broke college roommates with polar opposite personalities. 
Yumi (Shiori Kubo) isn’t particularly passionate about anything and works part-time at a used book and DVD shop, while Ruka (Yuna Taira) pursues her dream of being a musician as the guitarist and vocalist of the indie band "Peat Moth”. One day, a major record label approaches Ruka with an offer that could change everything for the two friends.
