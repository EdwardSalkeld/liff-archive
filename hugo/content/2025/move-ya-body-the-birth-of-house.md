House music has a fascinating history and in Move Ya Body director Elegance Bratton takes us from its conception in late 70s Chicago to its huge influence on pop superstars like Lady Gaga and Beyoncé. 

Teenager Vince Lawrence was the target of racist violence at the infamous 'Disco Demolition Night' in 1979. He received a settlement and bought a Moog synthesizer, recording 'On and On,' the first house record, stoking a technologically innovative musical subculture made by Black and queer people.
