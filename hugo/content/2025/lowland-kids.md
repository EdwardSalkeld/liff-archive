A timely debut, focusing on the resettlement of a community, dubbed the United States’ first climate refugees.

Isle de Jean Charles, connected to the mainland by a single road, has been home to a largely Indigenous community for generations. Now, rising seas and storms threaten their way of life. Filmed over six years and seen through the eyes of two teenagers, the film captures their emotional journey of resettlement. It offers a powerful glimpse into life on the frontline of the climate crisis.
