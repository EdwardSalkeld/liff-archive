Icelandic director Hlynur Pálmason’s follow-up to Godland is a tender and playful portrait of a family in flux, shot on luminous 35mm.
Across a year in rural Iceland, artist Anna and fisherman Magnús navigate marital separation while co-parenting their three children (played by Pálmason’s own). Pálmason delicately captures the changing seasons and shifting family dynamics with warmth, humour and touches of absurdity, crafting an intimate meditation on love, nature, and unconventional families.
