Bye Bye Brazil is a bittersweet Brazilian road movie about a rapidly modernising country leaving its traditions behind. 
A circus troupe rolls into town with the Gypsy Lord at the mic: he does magic tricks, the erotic Salomé dances, and the mute Swallow performs feats of strength. A wide eyed young accordion player begs to join them and brings along his young pregnant wife. Together they encounter excitement, joy and heartbreak on their travels from the coast deep into the Amazon.
