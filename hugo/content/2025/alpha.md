Julia Ducournau follows her award-winning Titane with this genre-bending family drama. 
Young Alpha returns home with a freshly branded tattoo made with a dirty needle, much to her mother’s panic. At the same time, her mysterious uncle returns and a virus spreads through the population, turning people into stone before crumbling to dust. A coming-of-age story cleverly blended with genre elements, Alpha is a more tender film from Ducournau, but one that’s as provocative as you’d expect.
