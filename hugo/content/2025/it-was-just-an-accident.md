Winner of the Palme d’Or at this year’s Cannes, Jafar Panahi’s It Was Just an Accident is a bold, darkly satirical thriller that confronts the violence of Iran’s repressive regime head-on.
A minor traffic collision sparks a tense reunion between two men with a shared, traumatic past — one a victim, the other possibly his former torturer. What begins as an almost absurd road trip escalates into a gripping moral reckoning on justice, revenge, and the possibility of mercy.

Contains scenes of graphic violence or injury and tortures, and themes of bereavement and death.
