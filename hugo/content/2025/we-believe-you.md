An unbearably tense courtroom drama, We Believe You is an extraordinary debut feature by Belgian filmmakers Charlotte Devillers and Arnaud Dufeys. 

Miriam Akheddiou holds the film together with an intense performance as mother Alice, who has to represent her two children in a custody battle against a father who stands accused of sexual abuse. In a legal system where victims struggle to be heard and difficult confrontations are enforced, can she protect them and ensure justice is upheld?

Contains themes of sexual abuse.
