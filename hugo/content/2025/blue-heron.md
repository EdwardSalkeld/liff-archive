Blue Heron marks a striking debut from Canadian-Hungarian filmmaker Sophy Romvari, who draws on her own childhood experiences to create an intimate and heartrending drama.
Set on Vancouver Island in the 1990s, Blue Heron depicts family life through the eyes of a young Sasha as her parents reckon with the increasingly volatile behaviour of her older brother, Jeremy. Romvari’s sensitive exploration of family trauma, memory, and grief leaves a lasting impression.
Contains themes of self-harm.
