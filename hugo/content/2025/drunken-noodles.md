Lucio Castro’s Drunken Noodles is playful and profound, an understated drama about desire and intimacy full of surprising, sensuous encounters through one hazy summer. 
Adnan, a young art student, arrives in New York City to flat-sit for a friend. He begins interning at a gallery where an artist who specialises in embroidered queer erotica is being exhibited. This opens a portal to his own desire as moments from his past and present intertwine in a gently captivating, magical realist tapestry.

Contains sexually explicit scenes.
