A bold and hypnotic return from director Bi Gan (Long Day's Journey into Night) that affirms his status as one of cinema’s most ambitious visionaries. 
Told in six chapters, each aligned with one of the five senses and the mind, the film follows immortal characters living through different eras and genres. With its shifting timeframes and experimental structure, Resurrection is an ode to the past, present and future of cinema, and will mesmerise and entrance audiences long after viewing.
