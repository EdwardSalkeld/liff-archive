A Palestinian director in the US reflects on identity through an online friendship with a young parkour artist in Gaza.
Areeb first visited Gaza aged four, a memory tied to her mother’s smile. Years later, a parkour video of Ahmed on Gaza’s shores sparks nostalgia. Through a ten-year friendship, they explore Gaza’s ruins, revealing the harsh realities of life under occupation. An exploration of homeland and a nail-biting sports tale.
