In this sweeping, lyrical epic, writer-director Mona Fastvold (The Brutalist) reimagines the life of Ann Lee, the visionary founder of the Shakers, who proclaimed herself the female incarnation of Christ.
 
Spanning from industrial Manchester to pre-revolutionary America, The Testament of Ann Lee vividly captures the ecstatic fervour of a movement built on song, devotion, and radical equality. Amanda Seyfried gives an electrifying career-best performance in this richly detailed period piece.[Please note that The Testament of Ann Lee is a new addition to the LIFF 2025 programme and was not included in the printed guide.]
