title = "The Shepherd and the Bear"
+++
Set in the sublime mountainscapes of the French Pyrenees, the reintroduction of brown bears ignites a fierce conflict within a traditional shepherding community.
Max Keegan’s compelling debut follows an ageing shepherd searching for a successor, and a teenage boy enthralled by the predators threatening the flock. Immersive and visually stunning, The Shepherd and the Bear unfolds like a modern folktale, reflecting on tradition and our coexistence with the natural world.

Contains graphic scenes of animal injury.
