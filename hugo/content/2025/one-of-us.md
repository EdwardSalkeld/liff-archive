Marine Place’s powerful documentary takes us to the LGBTQIA+ Centre in Lille, France where dedicated volunteers coach asylum seekers who are fleeing persecution because of their sexuality. 
To obtain asylum in France, they will have to provide proof of their homosexuality or transidentity. In intense scenes, they have to grapple with difficult testimonies, explaining why they have had to hide to survive in their home countries. The film imbues a real, inspiring sense of solidarity and community.
