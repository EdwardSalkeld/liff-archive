Agnès Varda's stark portrayal of defiant teenage drifter Mona (Sandrine Bonnaire) is a startling and singular work of cinema.
Found perished from the cold at the film’s beginning, Mona's story is stitched together through flashbacks told by those she encountered before her death. Winner of the Golden Lion at the 1985 Venice Film Festival, Vagabond is a poetic, compassionate look at homelessness and a young woman’s refusal of conventional life and femininity.
