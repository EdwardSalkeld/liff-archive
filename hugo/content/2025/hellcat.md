A woman must find a way out when she wakes up in a moving trailer in this simple but effective horror.
Lena wakes up drowsy with a nasty wound on her arm and no recollection of ever getting in the moving vehicle she finds herself within. Things only get worse when the voice of the driver comes through telling her they have one hour to find a doctor or she’ll meet a horrible fate. Hellcat presents a game of survival and trust that goes both ways and will keep you guessing the whole way through.

Content scenes of graphic violence and scenes of people being held against their will.
