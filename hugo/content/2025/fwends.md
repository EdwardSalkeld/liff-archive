Two friends reunite over a weekend in Melbourne in this hilarious, improvised ode to mid-twenties friendship.
When old friend Em visits on a whim, Jessie becomes a tour guide. As they walk the streets trying to reconnect, they find increasingly funny ways to distract themselves from their problems and the uncertainty of their futures. Almost entirely improvised on a budget of 5000 AUD, Sophie Somerville’s mumblecore debut is a raw and deeply relatable portrait of the messiness of adult life. 

Contains discussions of sexual assault and harrassment, scenes of drug use.
