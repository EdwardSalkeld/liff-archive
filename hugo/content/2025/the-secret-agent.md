Brazilian Director Kleber Mendonça Filho hits dizzying new heights with The Secret Agent, a complex and riveting political thriller set in the paranoid 1970s with unexpected streaks of absurdist black humour and bags of style. 
Wagner Moura plays a university professor who travels from São Paulo to the seaside city of Recife during Carnival week, hoping to reunite with his son. He finds out he’s being tailed by hitmen hired by a corrupt federal officer. One of the best films of the year.
