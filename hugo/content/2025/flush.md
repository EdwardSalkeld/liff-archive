A darkly comic horror-thriller about a down-on-his-luck dad whose night takes a grotesque turn in the toilets of a grimy nightclub.
Luc is an aging, cocaine-addicted father desperate to prove he can change. Hoping to make amends, he visits the club where his ex works, only to stumble upon a secret stash of drugs. Old habits die hard, and soon he draws the wrath of a ruthless drug dealer, ending up trapped headfirst in a toilet as the night descends into chaos, humiliation and bodily fluids.
