title = "Trains"
+++
Elegantly compiled from wordless black and white archive footage, Trains is a sweeping history of people, industry and conflict in twentieth century Europe, all focussed on one piece of life changing technology: the locomotive. 

From vast industrial assemblies of steam engines to excited passengers chugging through beautiful scenery, the film takes a darker turn through the repurposed war machines of the century’s great conflicts. The film makes a mesmerising, uniquely cinematic journey.


Contains wartime footage.
