William Wyler’s Roman Holiday remains one of Hollywood’s most enchanting romantic comedies.
Audrey Hepburn, radiant in her Oscar-winning debut, stars as a runaway princess who, while on a European tour, escapes her royal duties to explore Rome incognito. Gregory Peck plays an American reporter who stumbles upon her, hoping for a scoop, but instead he is swept into a whirlwind of Vespa rides and romantic encounters. A timeless classic full of humour, heart and elegance.

Contains mild violence and very mild sex references.
