title = "Touki Bouki"
+++
Restless young lovers Mory and Anta roam Dakar on a horn-adorned motorbike, scheming to escape Senegal for a dreamlike Paris, in this landmark of African cinema.
Djibril Diop Mambéty’s Touki Bouki fuses surreal imagery, frenetic editing, and bursts of colour and sound into a feverish road movie. Blending oral tradition with an avant-garde style, the film captures both the disillusion of post-independence Senegalese society and the intoxicating pull of imagined freedom.
Restored in 2008 by The World Cinema Foundation at Cineteca di Bologna/L’Immagine Ritrovata in association with the family of Djibril Diop Mambéty. Restoration funding provided by Armani, Cartier, Qatar Airways and Qatar Museum Authority.

Contains scenes of animal slaughter.
