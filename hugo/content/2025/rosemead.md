Based on a harrowing true story, Rosemead is a gripping, emotionally charged portrait of a mother’s love pushed to its limits.
In cinematographer Eric Lin’s first feature as director, Lucy Liu delivers a stunning performance as a terminally ill Chinese immigrant in southern California who uncovers her teenage son's disturbing fixation with mass shootings. As her health deteriorates, she takes increasingly desperate - and morally complex - measures to protect him and confront the darkness he’s drawn to.[Please note that the screening of Rosemead featured in the printed guide on 31 October is cancelled.]
Contains disturbing scenes of violence.
