Winner of the Golden Lion at Venice, Éric Rohmer’s The Green Ray is a luminous tale of summertime melancholy and romantic longing.
Marie Rivière gives a radiant, improvised performance as Delphine, a newly single Parisian secretary drifting from Cherbourg to Biarritz in search of love and meaning. With rare delicacy, Rohmer captures the ache of loneliness, the promise of chance encounters, and a fleeting sunset that becomes pure transcendence and one of cinema’s most unforgettable final moments.
