This surreal, graphic and beautifully twisted rotoscope animation explores witchcraft, werewolves and corruption in 17th-century Europe. 
When a small village consumed by religious fervour puts a woman on trial for witchcraft, the proceedings are disrupted by a stranger who claims to be a werewolf. As his influence spreads, fear turns to desire and the villagers descend into carnality and chaos. Inspired by folklore and real events, this striking, sexualised vision is unforgettable and unique.

Contains frequent animated nudity and depictions of sex. Brief sexual activity with an animal. Contains scenes of sexism.
