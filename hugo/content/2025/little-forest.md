With its sumptuous cooking sequences and tender reflections, Little Forest is a heartfelt ode to food, friendship, and the restorative pleasures of slowing down. 
In Yim Soon-rye’s gentle, nourishing drama, Hye-won (Kim Tae-ri - The Handmaiden) leaves behind the pressures of Seoul to return to her rural childhood home. As she tends the land, rekindles old friendships, and prepares seasonal meals of exquisite simplicity, she begins to heal from past wounds and rediscover her sense of self.
