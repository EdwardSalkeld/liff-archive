A mesmerising psychological drama from acclaimed Argentine filmmaker Milagros Mumenthaler.
After accepting an award in Switzerland, fashion designer Lina impulsively jumps from a bridge into icy waters. On her return to Buenos Aires, something inside her has shifted, and she struggles to resume daily life with her husband and young daughter. Isabel Aimé González-Sola gives an outstanding performance as Lina in this singular and deeply resonant exploration of mental health, trauma and motherhood.
