A sensual yet sobering portrait of youthful rebellion and first love, Summer with Monika was Ingmar Bergman’s international breakthrough.
Harriet Andersson, in her debut collaboration with Bergman, is luminous as Monika, a 17-year-old who escapes Stockholm with boyfriend Harry (Lars Ekborg) for an idyllic, carefree summer on the archipelago. Tender and devastating, the film’s erotic candour and vision of young love would inspire filmmakers of the French New Wave.

Contains nudity, mild sex references, violence, strong language.
