+++
Gabriel Mascaro’s The Blue Trail is an entrancing, inspiring and visually lush film odyssey and a striking critique of ageism and authoritarianism.
In a near-future Brazil, the government gives priority to the country’s younger generations, while older people are put away in colonies so they will not “get in the way”. The 77-year-old Tereza (Denise Weinberg) refuses to submit and decides to escape, embarking on a transformative journey through the Amazon to fulfil one last wish before she loses her freedom.
[Please note that there is now an additional screening of The Blue Trail on 4 November.] 

Contains scenes of graphic violence or injury, and nudity.
