title = "Fantasy"
+++
A bold and confident debut from Slovenian-Macedonian filmmaker and musician Kukla, Fantasy is a vivid exploration of gender identity and desire.
Tomboy friends Mihrije, Sina and Jasna refuse to conform to the patriarchal world around them, but their lives shift when they meet Fantasy, a free-spirited transgender woman. With a strong visual style and dynamic use of music, the film celebrates friendship, self-discovery and queerness in contemporary Slovenia.
Contains flashing lights and imagery. 

Contains some homophobic and sexist language.
