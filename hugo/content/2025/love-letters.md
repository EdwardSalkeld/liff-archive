Ella Rumpf (Julia Ducournau’s Raw) and Monia Chokri give exceptional performances in Alice Douard’s debut feature Love Letters, a tender and affecting drama inspired by the director’s own experiences of queer parenthood. 
Set just after France legalised same-sex marriage, Céline and her wife Nadia are expecting their first child. But as Céline must gather letters of support to legally adopt her daughter-to-be, she is forced to confront her estranged mother and her own fears of repeating past mistakes.
