Idealistic teenagers really do change the world in Middletown, a fascinating documentary about a high school project that became a genuinely groundbreaking work of investigative journalism. 

An inspiring teacher encourages his upper state New York class of ‘91 to make a video which becomes an exposé of a toxic waste dumping scandal uncovering political corruption and organised crime. The now middle aged protagonists look back at this transformative experience with humour and emotional insight.
