An unusual, immersive blend of documentary and re-enactment tells the extraordinary true story of Carapiru, an indigenous man who survived the massacre of his Amazonian tribe and wandered alone through the forests and mountains of central Brazil for a decade. 
He eventually settles in a remote village and then a government agency tries to repatriate him with his native people. Andrea Tonacci’s thoughtful film centres on the real Carapiru and constantly challenges preconceptions about native people.
