Shot entirely on DV, this haunting found-footage horror follows a filmmaker investigating the mysterious disappearance of his long-missing sister. 
Returning to his small hometown in the backwoods of New Jersey, Robbie Lyle moves back in with his still-grieving mother to interview the local townsfolk and retrace the final steps of his sister. An atmospheric, simmering, and ultimately terrifying horror about the memory of those we lose and the ghosts we carry with us.

Contains scenes and discussions around grief and bereavement.
