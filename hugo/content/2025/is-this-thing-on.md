In actor and filmmaker Bradley Cooper’s tender and funny third feature film as director, Will Arnett and Laura Dern play a couple who seek new purpose as their marriage quietly unravels. 
Alex and Tess Novak – parents of two young boys – decide to split up after their marriage has reached an impasse. Their separation leads to unpredictable midlife self-reckonings, most dramatically in Alex’s wild career pivot to become a confessional stand-up comedian in New York City’s West Village, where he finds new direction and camaraderie.
