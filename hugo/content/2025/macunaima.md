title = "Macunaíma"

Macunaima is a vibrant and carnivalesque satirical comedy, an unusually playful highlight of Brazil’s fiercely political Cinema Novo movement and its first genuine Box Office hit. 

The fantastical story follows our eponymous hero miraculously born fully grown as a black man in the Amazonian jungle. He transforms into a white man as he ventures out into the city, falling in love with a revolutionary and clashing with a wealthy industrialist. A bit like a multicultural Brazilian Monty Python.
