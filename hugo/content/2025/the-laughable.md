This Leeds-set experimental documentary by Sarah Browne explores what is laughed at and who gets to laugh.
Six disabled comedians perform on a bare sound stage, confronting taboo subjects from transphobia to religion. With no laugh track or live audience, the onus falls on cinema-goers to decide what is laughable. Commissioned by the research project Imagining Technologies for Disability Futures, a LIFF partner in 2022, The Laughable radically reconsiders the ethics of laughter.
This screening is followed by a Q&A with the filmmaker and cast members.
