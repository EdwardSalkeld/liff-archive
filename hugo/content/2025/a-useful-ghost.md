Visually striking, haunting and sharply funny, A Useful Ghost is a wildly inventive tale and unlike anything you’ll see this year. 
Director Ratchapoom Boonbunchachoke plays with form and tone in a bold and genre-defying debut that won the top prize at this year’s Cannes Critics’ Week. When Nat unexpectedly returns from the dead as a vacuum cleaner, she tries to reconnect with her husband, to the dismay of her in-laws. Beneath its surreal premise, the film explores Thai history, grief, and usefulness.

Contains scenes of nudity, violence, and death.
