Written and produced by Portishead co-founder Geoff Barrow, Game is a gripping and unpredictable thriller set in the 90s rave scene. 
Marc Bessant plays an ageing raver who steals a stash at his final party but ends up in a car crash. Trapped and struggling for survival, he encounters a menacing poacher played by Jason Williamson (vocalist from Sleaford Mods). Director John Minton hones a tense and hallucinatory film taking the viewer way beyond the expectations of thriller conventions.
Contains scenes of drug use and injury detail.
