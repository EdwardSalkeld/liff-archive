A groundbreaking work of American independent cinema, Barbara Loden’s Wanda is a stark, unsentimental portrait of a woman adrift in Rust Belt America.
Inspired by a news story, Loden wrote, directed, and starred as Wanda, a coal miner’s wife who abandons her family and drifts through bars, motels, and desolate landscapes, eventually falling in with a hapless thief. With an intimate vérité style, Wanda is a quietly devastating vision of a woman searching for something beyond the roles assigned to her.

Contains scenes of domestic abuse and sexual threat.
