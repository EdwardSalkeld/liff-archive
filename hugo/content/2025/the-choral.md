From director Nicholas Hytner and writer Alan Bennett (who also collaborated on The History Boys and The Lady in the Van), The Choral is a rousing period comedy drama filmed in Bradford. 
As war rages on the Western Front in 1916, the Choral Society in Ramsden, Yorkshire has lost most of its men to the army. The Choral’s ambitious committee decides to recruit local young males with the help of new chorus master Dr. Henry Guthrie (Ralph Fiennes). As conscription papers arrive, the whole community discovers that the best response is to make music together.

Contains scenes of sexual violence.
