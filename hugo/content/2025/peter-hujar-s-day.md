Ben Whishaw delivers a standout performance in Ira Sachs’s intimate day-in-the-life portrait of 70s photographer Peter Hujar. 
Based on a 1974 conversation with writer Linda Rosenkrantz, he recounts what appears to him as a day of unremarkable interactions with Sontag, Burroughs and Ginsberg, while Linda listens with quiet curiosity and admiration. Minimal in action yet rich in human detail, Peter Hujar’s Day captures the spontaneity and intimacy of an underappreciated New York icon.
