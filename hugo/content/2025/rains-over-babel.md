title = "Rains Over Babel"
+++
Blending steampunk, magic realism, and Afrofuturism, director Gala del Sol’s first feature is an exuberant dark comic fantasy inspired by Dante’s Inferno, with a terrific ensemble of trans and queer characters. 
In a city suspended between worlds, a group of misfits gathers at Babel, a legendary neon-lit dive bar that doubles as purgatory. There, they face La Flaca, the elegant and unyielding embodiment of Death. Souls gamble years of their lives in high-stakes games, daring to do the impossible: outwit Death herself.

Contains drug use and scenes of moderate violence.
