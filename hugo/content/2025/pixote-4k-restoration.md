title = "Pixote (4K Restoration)"
+++
Hector Babenco’s 1980 masterpiece is both a gripping crime drama and a devastating exposé of how political corruption and police brutality drive street kids into the São Paulo underworld. 
Pixote, a ten year old homeless boy is thrown into a juvenile prison, eventually breaking into a life of drugs and street crime. With incredible performances from a cast of non-professionals, all from similar backgrounds to the characters, the film is immediate, shocking and heartrendingly moving.
