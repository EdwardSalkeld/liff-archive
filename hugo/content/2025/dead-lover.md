title = "Dead Lover"
+++
Shot on 16mm, this delightfully strange love story follows a lonely gravedigger who tries to resurrect the love of her life. 
The blossoming love between a gravedigger (who smells like corpses) and a poet is cut short by a tragic accident. Grief-stricken and in possession of his severed finger, she uses her knowledge of dead bodies to try to bring him back in a highly inventive tale inspired by Frankenstein. Written by and starring Grace Glowicki and Ben Petrie (also in LIFF2025 film Honey Bunch).
Contains some bloody gore and references to death, grief and mental health.
