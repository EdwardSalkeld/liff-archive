An unknown disease spreads fear through a 1980s desert town, in this Cannes Un Certain Regard winner.
Teenage Lidia lives happily with her large queer family at Mama Boa’s cabaret, but their haven shatters when rumours spread that the illness transmits through two men by a simple glance of love. As accusations mount, Lidia must uncover the truth to protect them from the town. Part modern Western, part Almodóvar-inspired melodrama, Diego Céspedes’ striking debut marks a director to watch. 

Contains themes of homophobia and transphobia, scenes of domestic violence.
