A food courier who offers sex services on the side becomes entangled in a string of grisly murders in this surreal, psychedelic horror-thriller. 
Cycling through the streets of Chicago with his business-partner girlfriend, Liam delivers food and illicit sexual encounters to his eager clients, until they start turning up gruesomely murdered. Shot on 16mm, Anything That Moves channels sordid 70s exploitation films and giallo horror, creating a fever-dream film experience which is often as funny as it is graphic.
Contains scenes with graphic violence, strong sexualised nudity and sex and threats of sexual violence.
