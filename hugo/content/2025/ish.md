Imran Perretta’s feature debut is a tender and powerful coming of age story, set against the backdrop of Britain’s fraught political landscape.
In a Bedfordshire town, teenagers Ish and Maram are inseparable. Their friendship however is tested when they become the targets of police harassment. Shot in striking monochrome and accompanied by a distinctive score, this is a bold British film, that places marginalised characters at its centre and exposes the deep-rooted biases that continue to run through society.
Contains flashing lights and imagery. 
Contains themes of racism.
