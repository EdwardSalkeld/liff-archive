A young girl’s first love awakens something darker within her when another woman gets in her way.
Diego has been teasing something of a romance with Natalia for a little while, but when he begins to see an older woman, Natalia refuses to sit back in silence. Quiet on the surface, much like its main character, The Virgin of the Quarry Lake is a captivating supernatural coming-of-age film that explores the depths of hormonal frustration, somewhere between The Virgin Suicides and The Craft.

Contains scenes of strong violence and sex.
