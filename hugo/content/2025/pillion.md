Harry Lighton’s bold, funny, and unexpectedly tender debut, reinvents the queer love story. 
Colin (Harry Melling), a mild-mannered young man still living with his parents, is swept into the orbit of Ray (Alexander Skarsgård), an enigmatic biker who draws him into a BDSM relationship. As Colin gives himself over to Ray, he begins to uncover his own desires and boundaries. Anchored by fearless performances, Pillion is a refreshingly original and moving portrait of love and self-discovery.

Contains nudity and sex scenes including some graphic scenes.
