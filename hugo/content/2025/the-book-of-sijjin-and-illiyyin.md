From two of the leading women horror filmmakers in Southeast Asia, writer Lele Laila and director Hadrah Daeng Ratu, The Book of Sijjin and Illiyyin is a visceral Indonesian tale of black magic revenge
In rural Indonesia, Yuli grows up despised within her father’s household. Seeking retribution, she turns to a shaman and summons a djinn through corpse-bound ritual. The film fuses Islamic cosmology with unflinching body horror, transforming domestic cruelty into an eerie and blood-soaked vision of spiritual reckoning.

Contains scenes with strong graphic violence and gore.
