+++
Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn sparkle in George Cukor’s sophisticated comedy of manners from 1938.
Grant plays Johnny Case, a self-made man who dreams of escaping work for a life of freedom and plans to take a year-long holiday, an idea that shocks his wealthy fiancée but delights her spirited older sister Linda (Hepburn). Brimming with pithy dialogue and irresistible chemistry, Holiday is a comedic masterpiece from Hollywood’s golden age, and one of Cukor’s best.
