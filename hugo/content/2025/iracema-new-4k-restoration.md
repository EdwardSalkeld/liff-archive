+++
Iracema is an atmospheric Brazilian road movie and a savage critique of the political hypocrisies of its time. 
It’s shot in guerilla style in a national security zone soon after the construction of the environmentally ruinous Trans-Amazonian Highway. Indigenous teenager Iracema leaves her family and falls into work as a prostitute. She meets Tião Brasil Grande, an unscrupulous truck driver and apologist for the Brazilian economic miracle, an unfortunate companion for a heartrending odyssey.
