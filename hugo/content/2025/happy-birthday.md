A child maid is exposed to a class system she can’t understand in this stunning Tribeca winner and Egypt’s Oscar entry.
Eight-year-old Toha bonds with her wealthy employer’s daughter, Nelly. Having never celebrated her own birthday with family, she throws herself into planning Nelly’s party. But as her ties with the family deepen, rigid class divides emerge, exposing Toha to the harsh realities of privilege and exploitation in this tender, unflinching debut led by a stunning central performance.
Contains themes of child abuse.
