+++
A vibrant portrait of Ireland’s folk renaissance, Celtic Utopia captures a new wave of musicians who are bold, funny, and politically outspoken.
Featuring the likes of The Mary Wallopers, The Deadlians, Young Spencer, Lankum and more, these artists grapple with Ireland’s complex past, confronting legacies of colonialism while imagining freer futures. With humour, honesty, and a loose energy, the film celebrates music’s power to challenge painful histories while shaping what comes next.
