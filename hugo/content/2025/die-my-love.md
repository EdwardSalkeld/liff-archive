+++
Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattinson star in Lynne Ramsay’s striking drama about a woman’s descent into psychosis. 
Grace and Jackson leave New York for the country with their baby, seeking space for Grace to write. But something has changed in her since the birth, which has unleashed primal urges and threatens her grip on reality. Lawrence is stunning as a wife driven to the edge, in a sharp screenplay by Ramsay, Enda Walsh and Alice Birch about the collapse of a relationship post-childbirth.

Contains themes of self harm and suicide.
