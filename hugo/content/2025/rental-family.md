Hikari’s Rental Family is a poignant comedy drama starring Oscar-winner Brendan Fraser as an American actor in Tokyo whose life is changed when he is cast for an unusual role. 
Philip (Fraser) has lived in Japan for seven years with little acting success until he’s recruited to play “sad American” at an actual funeral and is offered more stand-in roles working for a Japanese ‘rental family’ agency. As he immerses himself in his clients' worlds, he begins to form genuine bonds that blur the lines between performance and reality.
