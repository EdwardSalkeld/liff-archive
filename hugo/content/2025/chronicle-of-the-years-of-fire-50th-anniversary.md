This epic six-part tale of the Algerian Revolution became the first African film to win the Cannes Palme d’Or 50 years ago. 
Through a farmer’s eyes, the long build-up from WWII to the Algerian War of Independence is meticulously recounted, painting a merciless portrait of colonial Algeria and the strength of organised resistance. Restored with impeccable care by The Film Foundation’s World Cinema Project and Cineteca di Bologna, its masterful cinematography demands to be seen on the big screen.
This screening is presented in partnership with Cinema Africa at Hyde Park Picture House. 
Restoration supported by the Hobson/Lucas Family Foundation. This restoration is part of the African Film Heritage Project, created by The Film Foundation, FEPACI and UNESCO – in collaboration with Cineteca di Bologna – to help locate, restore, and disseminate African cinema.
Contains scenes of war, physical violence and slavery.
