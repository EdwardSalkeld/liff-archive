Restored uncut for the big screen on its 50th anniversary, Ramesh Sippy’s towering classic Sholay is an epic ‘curry western’ packed with exhilarating action, musical numbers, Indian cinema’s most iconic actors, and jaw-dropping widescreen cinematography. 
Sholay follows Thakur Baldev Singh (Sanjeev Kumar), a retired police officer seeking vengeance against the notorious dacoit Gabbar Singh (Amjad Khan). Thakur hires two small-time criminals, Jai and Veeru (unforgettably portrayed by Amitabh Bachchan and Dharmendra), to capture Gabbar.
Contains some violence.
