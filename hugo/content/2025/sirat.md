Winner of the Cannes Jury Prize, Oliver Laxe’s Sirāt is a hallucinatory odyssey that demands to be experienced on the big screen.
A father (Sergi López) and his young son scour the Moroccan desert, searching for a daughter lost to the rave scene. Along the way, they join a nomadic community of ravers and are swept into a world of pounding techno, dust storms, and looming conflict. Shot on Super 16mm and with a thunderous score, this apocalyptic road trip is raw and unforgettable cinema.[Please note that there is now an additional screening of Sirāt on 31 October.]

Contains scenes with drug use and graphic violence.
