title = "The Arch (New 4K Restoration)"
+++
A beautiful 4K restoration of a little known film that should be elevated to classic status, the graceful, nuanced The Arch was made in 1968 by Hong Kong’s first female film director, T’ang Shushuen.
In 17th century China a young widow, Madam Tung, lives a virtuous life but when a military captain arrives, a passion between them grows that can never be fulfilled. Innovatively directed, the film cleverly reveals the emotional turmoil beneath an elegantly controlled surface.
The restoration of The Arch is made possible by the support of CHANEL, M+’s Major Partner.[Please note that the two screenings of The Arch featured in the printed guide on 31 October and 4 November are cancelled and replaced by one screening on 15 November.]
