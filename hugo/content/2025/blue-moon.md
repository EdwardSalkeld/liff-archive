Ethan Hawke delivers a career-best performance as legendary lyricist Lorenz Hart in Richard Linklater’s evocative and captivating chamber piece. 
Set on the opening night of Oklahoma!, a loquacious Hart awaits his former collaborator Richard Rodgers at the afterparty in iconic Broadway bar Sardi’s. With superb performances from Margaret Qualley, Bobby Cannavale, and Andrew Scott as Rodgers, Blue Moon is a witty yet melancholic portrait of friendship, art, and faded glory.
