Christian Petzold’s Mirrors No. 3 is a compact, superbly crafted psychodrama that grips from start to finish.
When music student Laura (Paula Beer) survives a countryside car crash that kills her boyfriend, she is taken in by Betty, a benevolent stranger. As the two women fall into a quiet routine, the return of Betty’s family stirs unease. Elegant and unsettling, Petzold’s beguiling tale explores loss, trauma, and the unorthodox ways we cope with grief.
Contains themes of suicide.
