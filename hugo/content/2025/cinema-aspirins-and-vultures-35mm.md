Far from Europe’s darkest hour at the peak of the Second World War, two men meet in the Brazilian outback in this bewitching Brazilian road movie. 

Johann is a German who has escaped from the war, and Ranulpho, a Brazilian who wants to leave his backwater home town for Rio. Driving from village to village, they show a film to the inhabitants who have never before experienced cinema in order to sell a brand new 'miracle' medicine. A gently moving and lyrical film with beautiful cinematography.
