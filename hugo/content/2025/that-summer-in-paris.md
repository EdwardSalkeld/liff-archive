title = "That Summer in Paris"
+++
A vibrant and lyrical debut that frames a personal awakening against the drama and fanfare of the 2024 Paris Olympics. 
Thirty-year-old Blandine leaves her quiet life in Normandy to watch her favourite swimmer and reconnect with her half sister she hasn’t seen in a decade. Immersed and challenged by the energy of Paris, she begins to rediscover lost relationships, but also her own sense of self. A tender story about family, identity, and quiet transformation.
