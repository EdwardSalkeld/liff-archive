A reincarnated mermaid tries to find herself and adapt to the rigidity of the human world in this astonishing hybrid debut.
Part fiction, part documentary, Sirens Call follows a once mermaid now wandering Earth in a human body, as she joins the merfolk community in Oregon. Unlike anything else, Miri Ian Gossing and Lina Sieckmann’s debut is a meditative, true compassionate ode to unapologetically living your authentic self in a world that would prefer we all neatly fit into boxes.
