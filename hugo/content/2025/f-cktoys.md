A young sex worker attempts to challenge the universe’s dark karma in Annapurna Sriram’s distinct and surprising debut.
According to AP’s astrologer, the universe is out to get her. If only AP could get hold of $1,000 and a sacrificial lamb, she might be able to get rid of that dreaded curse. With hints of John Waters and Anna Biller, Annapurna Sriram has created a profound portrait of the ills of an entire generation disguised behind a rose-tinted filter and a brilliant soundtrack.

Contains scenes with drug use, graphic violence, sex, nudity.
