Director Maryam Touzani (Blue Caftan) returns with an endearing, big hearted drama boasting a towering performance from Carmen Maura. 
Maria Angeles is a 79-year-old Spanish woman who lives alone in Tangier, Morocco, and loves her hometown, the warm people and labyrinthine markets. However, her life is turned upside down when her daughter arrives from Madrid to sell the apartment where she’s always lived. Determined to stay, she digs in her heels and, unexpectedly, rediscovers love and sensuality.
