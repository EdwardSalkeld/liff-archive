A visionary classic of French cinema, and Jean Vigo’s only feature, L’Atalante, is a luminous tale of love, desire and disillusionment.
Newlyweds Jean and Juliette set sail on a canal barge, embarking on married life in cramped quarters alongside the eccentric old fisherman Père Jules and his cats. Restless with the monotony of barge life, Juliette is soon drawn to the allure of Paris. Blending social realism with poetic scenes, Vigo created one of cinema’s most hauntingly romantic masterpieces.

Contains brief nudity and infrequent sex references.
