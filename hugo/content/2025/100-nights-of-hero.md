Julia Jackman’s 100 Nights of Hero is a bold and beautiful, flamboyant and funny fairytale, adapted from Isabel Greenberg’s acclaimed graphic novel.
In a patriarchal kingdom where women are forbidden to read or write, Cherry (Maika Monroe) and her sharp-witted maid Hero (Emma Corrin) turn the tables on a cruel wager through the power of storytelling. With sumptuous set design, dry humour and a spirit of rebellion, Jackman conjures a riotous, imaginative queer fable and ode to female solidarity.
