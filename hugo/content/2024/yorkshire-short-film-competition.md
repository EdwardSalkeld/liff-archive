One of the annual event highlights at LIFF, this competition takes a celebratory survey of Yorkshire short filmmaking from the past year. Our programme unsurprisingly reflects the wonderfully diverse stories that cover the personal and local, yet world-facing nature of the county we call home. Insightful social dramas such as Predators and House Phone nestle comfortably alongside deeply honest and inspiring documentaries Paula Says Hi and From Lagos to Leeds. At different stages of their careers, what all the filmmakers in our competition share is the passion and vision to bring their work to the big screen for us to enjoy, together.
