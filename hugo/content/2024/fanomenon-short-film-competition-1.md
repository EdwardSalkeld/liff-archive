Relationships are at the heart of this programme of fantastic shorts where tensions often rise high. A sunny Sunday afternoon game of Scrabble takes a turn when the board comes to life, siblings must wrestle with dark truths to break free of a malevolent cycle, and a young woman finds herself truly alone when a government error separates her from her now-fish family. Elsewhere, a woman’s grief turns into addiction in a post-masculine world. And finally, a couple’s attempt to spice up their relationship with an AI sex robot, ends up uncovering the long-buried cracks in their marriage’s foundations.
