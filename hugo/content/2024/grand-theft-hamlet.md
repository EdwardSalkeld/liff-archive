A staging of Shakespeare’s Hamlet unlike any other you’ve seen before. This hilarious documentary follows two unemployed theatre actors as they take on the seemingly impossible challenge of staging a production of Hamlet within the violent world of the Grand Theft Auto video game. Filmed entirely within the game, the intrepid actors set out to find willing participants for their Shakespearean tragedy, holding in-game auditions, rehearsals and finally inviting the audience to an unforgettable performance. The results are surprisingly poignant and endlessly entertaining. One of the year’s most innovative and must-see documentaries.
