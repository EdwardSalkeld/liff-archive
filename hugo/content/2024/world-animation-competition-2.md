The second World Animation Competition programme features 10 more visionary shorts from across the globe, spanning skilful artistry in 2D, stop-motion and experimental forms of the genre. From the awe-inspiring depths of Brazilian folklore to serene Portuguese seashores, each film encapsulates something uniquely profound within the animated art-form, celebrating an array of International talent and storytelling. The programme is bookended by the work of animation industry icon Florence Miailhe and her elegant yet sorrowful new film Papillon, as well as the multi-award-winning festival favourite Tennis, Oranges by Sean Pecknold.
