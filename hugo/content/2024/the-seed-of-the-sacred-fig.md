Shot entirely in secret, The Seed of the Sacred Fig is an epic and searing anti-patriarchal thriller from director Mohammad Rasoulof, a target of Iran’s government for his films’ criticism of the state. The film centres on a family thrust into the public eye when the father Iman is appointed as an investigating judge in Tehran. As political unrest erupts on the streets, Iman realizes his job is even more dangerous than expected, making him increasingly paranoid and distrustful, even of his own wife Najmeh and their daughters Sana and Rezvan. When his gun disappears, his family breaks apart.
