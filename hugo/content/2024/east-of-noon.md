East of Noon is a vividly imaginative Egyptian fable and a
clever political satire, beautifully shot in luminous black and
white 16mm. Hala Elkoussy's second feature is set in a confined,
isolated community where the citizens are subject to a bizarre
and oppressive dictatorship. Shawky is an eccentric old showman
who rules with a mix of performance and fear, while Abdo is
a teenage prodigy who uses music to rebel against his elders,
and storyteller Jalala provides relief with stories of the Sea.
East of Noon is a sumptuous cinematic spectacle.
