In the early 2000s in a town near Hanoi in Vietnam, Tam, a
diligent wedding venue staffer, discovers her husband's affair
on live TV. Rather than confronting him, she enlists a powerful
spell master to win back his love. Tam's daughter, Ha, pours
her frustration into vivid fantasies of a brighter future abroad.
Meanwhile, a mysterious House Spirit, visible only to the women,
lurks beneath their cracked, leaky ceiling. Winner of the Grand
Prize at Venice Critics' Week in September, Duong Dieu Linh's
offbeat feature debut freshly explores modern Vietnamese society
in wry and magical ways.
