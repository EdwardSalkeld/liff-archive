The second British Short Film Competition programme continues our trip around these shores and far beyond. From the void of outer space where a child is born in Space Plug to the fast and furious streets of Northern Ireland in We Beg to Differ. Friendship and solidarity forms amongst migrants over canal fishing in Karavidhe, and on the dance floor amongst queer people of colour in Midnight Rising. These moving tales will shock and delight before a chance encounter at a rural petrol station ends our tales, where we began, with A Good Start.
