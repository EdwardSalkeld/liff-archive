Ralph Fiennes and Stanley Tucci lead a brilliant ensemble
cast in All Quiet on the Western Front director Edward Berger's
stunning adaption of Robert Harris' high-stakes drama, in which
Cardinals gather at the Vatican to elect a new Pope. When the
Pope unexpectedly dies, Cardinals from all over the world rush
to the Vatican, where they immediately sequester themselves.
Digital devices are stashed, doors are locked, and windows
are shuttered as they prepare for the election of a new leader
one who will not only provide spiritual guidance for the world's
Catholics, but set the tone for the future.
