This programme tackles everything from lovers’ quarrels and pregnancy to the danger of making deals with mermaids. A daughter wonders whether the thing knocking on the door is really her mother, while a couple can’t go on a trip until they’ve remembered everything (and we mean everything). A pregnant woman hears something strange on a wilderness camping trip, a couple have an argument with a bloody twist, and an app to help you sleep seems to have summoned something. Finally, a man turns to a sea-devil to get urgently married, and we see a paralyzed woman’s terror through her eyes.
