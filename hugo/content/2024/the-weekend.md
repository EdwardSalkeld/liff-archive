A smart, suspenseful horror-thriller from Nigerian director Daniel Oriahi, rooted in family values and culture but with a deliciously dark twist. Orphaned Nikya is close to having the life she’s always dreamed of - engaged to her partner, Luke, with hopes of starting a family. However, she has never met Luke’s estranged parents or sister. Desperate to complete her family, she convinces Luke to reconnect and they arrange a visit to his childhood home. But soon, Nikya begins to uncover disturbing secrets, realising that every family has its baggage - and Luke’s may be harder to stomach than she has ever imagined.
