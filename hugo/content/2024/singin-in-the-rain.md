Join us early on a Saturday morning for the first of our annual free breakfast screenings – and coffee will be brewed ready for you! In one of the most enduring musicals of all time, Gene Kelly and Lina Lamont star as silent movie actors working at the advent of the all-singing-and-dancing talkie era. Studio bosses grapple with the new technology and the suitability of their actors, and the arrival of a new young actress played expertly by Debbie Reynolds. It is hard not to sing along to this joyous film and the breath-taking musical numbers, offering an example of the musical genre at its most iconic.
