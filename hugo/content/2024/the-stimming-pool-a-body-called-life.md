A fascinating hybrid feature film, co-created by a collective of autistic artists, the Neurocultures Collective, and filmmaker Steven Eastwood, The Stimming Pool explores the possibilities of a world informed by autistic perspectives and perception. This wildly imaginative film celebrates each individual’s creativity and authorship and invites audiences into a neurodiverse world within the often-challenging structures of neurotypical environments. Screening with A Body Called Life (dir. Spencer MacDonald), about a young human who delves into the hidden world of microscopic organisms.
