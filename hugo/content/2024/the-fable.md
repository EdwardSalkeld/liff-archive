Raam Reddy's second feature is both a magical realist tale and an
incisive political allegory, beautifully shot in 16mm in the Indian
Himalayas. Dev owns a sprawling colonial style estate where he
lives with his family. He tinkers in his shed to maintain human-sized
wings, which he uses to soar over his woodlands and orchards.
Everything is tranquil until one morning he finds a single burnt apple
tree. Soon after, more trees are burnt and he engages his staff
and the local police to investigate the mystery though it fuels local
tensions and he begins to lose control.
