Gathering for what could be the last Christmas in their ancestral
home, four generations of the Balsano family intertwine, as
tensions boil and relatives reconnect. Taormina's camera glides
between the family members following no solid narrative;
exploring the family web through the eyes of overexcited children,
rebellious teenagers and bickering adults. At once charming
and uncomfortable, Taormina masterfully captures the feelings
of anticipation and disappointment of the festive season. With
an ensemble cast of indie darlings including Michael Cera and
Francessca Scorcese, this debut is a rich and nostalgic gift and
a love letter to American suburbia.
