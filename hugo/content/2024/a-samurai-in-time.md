A sleeper hit in Japan, this heartfelt fish-out-of-water comedy pays homage to samurai cinema and was made in memory of Seizo Fukumoto, Japan’s leading kirareyaku (‘sliced-up actor’) who died more than 50,000 times on camera. With one strike of lightning, samurai Kosaka Shinzaemon is teleported to modern day Japan, landing on a period drama film set. Mesmerised by the world of showbiz, he starts to make a living as a kirareyaku. Will Kosaka adapt to his new reality, or will the grudges of the Edo period war slice his life apart?
