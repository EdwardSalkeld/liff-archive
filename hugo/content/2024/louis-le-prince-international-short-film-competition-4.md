These five captivating films – each employing a unique visual language and emotional tone – weave threads across geographies and histories to bring the weight of expectations to the fore. The protagonist of A Dying Tree casts off embodied patriarch and individualistic norms through a haptic journey of self-acceptance, A Summer’s End Poem deals with disappointed expectations on the threshold between childhood and adolescence, while in The Man Who Could Not Remain Silent different cinematic and humanistic gazes are at play to challenge the viewer’s perception. Intimate yet universal, these shorts will resonate within you long after they’ve ended.
