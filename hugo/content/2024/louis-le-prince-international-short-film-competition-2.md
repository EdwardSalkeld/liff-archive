Our second Louis le Prince programme creates a cinematic tapestry of how violence transforms our definitions of home. In Happiness is Close, ageing changes a man’s relationship with his apartment and body. In Zanatany, When soulless shrouds whisper, On the way, and Aïda Neither, government failings lead to death and desecration, severing each protagonist’s ties to their hometown and histories. With humour and heartbreak, these visually rich stories ask us to examine the invisible brutalities that exile us from ourselves and, by concluding with the irreverent Honey Bunny, what it takes to reacquaint with tenderness.
