The latest film from Spanish auteur Jonás Trueba is a witty and subversive meta-comedy about a couple who decide that separations are just as worthy of celebration as unions. After 14 years together, Ale and Alex agree to amicably part ways, but not before hosting a big party to celebrate the ending of their relationship. Like a wedding, but the other way around. As they share the news with family and friends, what starts as an optimistic and unconventional plan quickly proves more difficult than anticipated. This anti-romantic comedy is a refreshing take on the messy complexities of breaking up.
