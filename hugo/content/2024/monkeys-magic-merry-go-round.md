Late Night with the Devil meets Blue’s Clues in this unsettling, existential horror that will forever change the way you see safety scissors. The presenter of a children’s TV show spends his days smiling, singing songs, and playing with his puppet pals Beaver, Bird and his best friend Monkey. That’s until he realises that he seems to have lost all his memories and his puppet co-stars are dead set on keeping it that way. Ready for a ride on the Magic Merry-Go-Round?
