After animating his acclaimed debut feature Away entirely by himself, Latvian filmmaker and animator Gints Zilbalodis assembled a team for his follow-up Flow and created a magical, thrilling, wordless animated adventure for all that received a rapturous reception at Cannes. Inspired by his experience of working alone on Away, Flow is all about teamwork. The world seems to be coming to an end, teeming with the vestiges of a human presence. Cat is a solitary animal, but as its home is devastated by a great flood, he finds refuge on a boat populated by various species – including a capybara and will have to team up with them despite their differences.
