In this surrealist black comedy from the daring mind of director Luis Buñuel, a group of wealthy friends are invited to a mansion for dinner by Edmundo Nobile after a night at the opera. Surreal events follow and they find themselves unable to leave, leading to chaos. Buñuel’s comic masterpiece exposes the fallacy and frivolity of the upper classes. Screening as part of the Stuart Croft season with the artist’s short film Century City in which the murder of an actress prompts an illogical, circular phone conversation between a Cape Town detective and a Los Angeles movie director.
