Singaporean director Yeo Siew Hua’s Stranger Eyes begins as a gripping surveillance thriller before it morphs into an enigmatic, psychological drama interrogating themes of intimacy and responsibility. After the unexplained disappearance of their baby daughter, a young couple receives strange videos documenting their daily lives, even in their most intimate moments. Initially they go to the police who set up their own surveillance system to identify the voyeur assuming his culpability as the kidnapper. But secrets are revealed and nothing is as it seems. The family begins to fall apart under the pressure.
