In this dark sci-fi drama, a teenage girl grapples with her family’s deepening devotion to a cosmic cult that promises a higher existence on Jupiter. Teenager Lea struggles to find her own path, torn between the pressures of adolescence, caring for her younger autistic brother, and her family’s cosmic beliefs. As the comet Calypso nears Earth in a rare celestial event, her family retreats to the cult’s remote compound in the woods. There, Lea begins to question their faith, wondering if this journey is truly about salvation—or a one-way trip to another plane of existence.
