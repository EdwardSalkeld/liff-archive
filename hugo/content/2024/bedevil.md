Multifaceted creator Tracey Moffatt is Australia’s leading visual artist of the last 40 years, and with BeDevil, the first Aboriginal woman to direct a feature film. Her film interlaces several different modes of cinema and 1990s TV to retell three ghostly folk tales, all of which suggest the haunted barriers of place and time between Aboriginal and settler Australia. The first story, Mr Chuck, recounts a drowned American G.I. haunting a cinema built on swampland, Choo Choo Choo Choo, is about an absconded train driver, and Lovin’ The Spin I’m In shows that some spirits can never be evicted in the name of a quick buck.
