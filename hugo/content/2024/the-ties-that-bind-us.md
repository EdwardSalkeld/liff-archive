The Ties That Bind Us from French writer/director Carine Tardieu is a compassionate, emotionally engaging film about what brings people together in times of adversity and the new kinds of family ties that can bloom unexpectedly. When the reluctant Sandra (Valeria Bruni Tedeschi), a fifty something feminist bookshop owner, is suddenly charged with looking after her neighbours’ five-year-old son when his mother’s waters break, she has no idea how their lives will change when tragedy strikes. With a superb ensemble cast of natural performers led by Tedeschi and Pio Marmaï, The Ties That Bind Us has an irresistible, lived in feel that is universally relatable.
