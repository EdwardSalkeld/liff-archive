Following her acclaimed documentary Romantic Comedy (2019), Elizabeth Sankey turns her attention to society, and the film industrys, fascination with witches. From the witch trials of the 1600s to the themes of Rosemary’s Baby, Sankey draws parallels between historical prejudice against women, motherhood and mental health, and contemporary screen representations of witches. Reflecting on her own experiences with postpartum depression and psychosis, Witches is simultaneously a visual ode to cinema, a deeply personal essay and a stark reminder of the lack of mental health support available to pregnant women in the UK.
