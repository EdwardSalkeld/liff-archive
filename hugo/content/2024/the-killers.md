This wildly inventive and entertaining collection of four crime stories refreshes the hitman genre and levels up the anthology film format. Inspired by Hemingway’s 1927 short story The Killers and Edward Hopper’s 1942 painting Nighthawks, these four takes on contract killing in our chaotic times include a vampire thriller oozing sexy splatter and undead subversion; an assassins-gone-foolishly-awry black comedy like Quentin Tarantino karaoke; a dangerously seductive neo-noir drenched in triple-cross betrayals; and a whiplash-inducing mash-up in gloriously assaultive monochrome. Each contributing their own distinctive style and vision, the quartet of South Korean filmmakers includes Lee Myung-Se (Nowhere to Hide). Versatile actress Shim Eun-kyung stars in three of the stories.
