Leeds Queer Film Festival are delighted to present this year’s Leeds Queer Short Film Competition at LIFF. Our first programme will transport you from a first date at a Mexican ice cream parlour in ¡Beso de lengua! through a Chinese reunion of old lovers in Manting to the politically charged resistance and joy of Floridian black queer and trans people in Shade in the Sunshine State. Body horror lovers are sure to enjoy the closing film of this programme, Belly Belly, a deliciously sexy meal featuring lots of blood, gore and severed fingers!
