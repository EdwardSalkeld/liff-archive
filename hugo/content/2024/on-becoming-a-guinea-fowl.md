Winning Best Director at Cannes, acclaimed writer-director Rungano Nyoni follows up her striking debut I Am Not a Witch with a bold and visionary work of grief and restitution. Driving home from a party at night, Shula happens upon the body of her Uncle Fred lying in the road. As the family begin to mourn, a wave of collective anger slowly rises among Shula and her cousins, as they reckon with long-suppressed past traumas. Blending surrealism with dark humour, Nyoni sharply critiques the societal traditions that work to hide abuses of power. On Becoming a Guinea Fowl solidifies Nyoni as one of today’s most distinctive filmmakers.
