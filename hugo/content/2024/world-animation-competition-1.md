The first World Animation Competition programme at LIFF 2024 includes animated gems from Belgium, China, Croatia, Japan and South Korea. This programme offers LIFF audiences the chance to be inspired by the creative possibilities and beauty of the form. From the edgy, comic genius of the Czech film Hurikán, to the delicately crafted Chinese short Bergamot, and the intricate stop motion in Nina Gantz’s Wander to Wonder, this selection has magic at its core. These animations will make you think, feel and laugh, adding sparkle to a November day.
