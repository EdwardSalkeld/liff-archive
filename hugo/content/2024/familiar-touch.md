One of the highlights of this year's Venice Film Festival, Sarah
Friedland's Familiar Touch won three top awards in the Horizons
section - Best Debut, Best Director, and Best Actress for Kathleen
Chalfant as Ruth. Familiar Touch is a refreshing, funny and very
moving coming of (old) age film about octogenarian Ruth and
her transition to life in assisted living as she contends with her
conflicting relationship to herself and her caregivers amidst her
shifting memory, age identity, and desires. Ruth disavows not only
the roles expected of her - Mother, Patient, Old Lady - but also her
'appropriate' age identity, sliding between feeling 85 and 25.
