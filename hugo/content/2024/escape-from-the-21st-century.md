In the year 1999, on a planet very much like our own - only 3,000 light years away - three teenagers find themselves exposed to chemical waste that gives them a unique ability: when they sneeze their consciousness travels 20 years into the future. With their sinuses now propelling them to and fro in time, they come to realise that the future sucks and they have power to change it. Writer-director Yang Li maintains a breakneck momentum, uses a dizzying array of special effects, and choreographs kinetic action that brilliantly integrates comic-book animation with magnificent martial art prowess.
