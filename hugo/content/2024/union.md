An extraordinary documentary about the gargantuan struggle of the Amazon Labor Union (ALU) to win the election to become the first officially unionised Amazon workplace in America. The film is made at the heart of the campaign following the ordinary workers, whose persistence and solidarity eventually pay off against an infinitely better resourced employer, absolutely committed to preventing them from reaching their goal. Described by ALU President Christian Smalls as the ‘N.W.A. of the organizing world,’ the group’s persona and strategies are highly unconventional: from wearing Money Heist costumes at press conferences to distributing free marijuana to workers.
