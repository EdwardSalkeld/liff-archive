Sean Baker returns with his Palme d’Or winning drama Anora, starring a breakthrough Mikey Madison as young sex worker Ani who falls for Russian heir Vanya at the club where she dances. The spoilt son of a Russian oligarch, Vanya introduces Ani to a lavish lifestyle resulting in a whirlwind marriage. But when news gets back to his parents of their son’s new wife, their disapproval sets in motion a dizzying adventure that’s fiercely entertaining yet heartbreaking in equal measure. Continuing Baker’s themes of highlighting the lives and work of marginalised people, Anora is a raucous tragicomedy that refuses to judge its subjects.
