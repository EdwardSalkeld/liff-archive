The paranoia of a sexless couple's relationship is explored through a
collage of surveillance video in this absurd dark comedy from Eugene
Kotlyarenko (Spree, Wobble Palace). Early-pandemic, Jay and Celine
(Peter Vack and Dasha Nekrasova) head to a rental house to reconnect.
While Celine films a documentary on their disintegrating relationship,
a recently 'cancelled' Jay becomes increasingly paranoid about his
portrayal, setting up hidden cameras to spy on Celine. Using footage
from over 70 cameras, memes and TikTok reels, Kotlyarenko presents
a voyeuristic exploration of the attention economy and our vapid
relationship with technology in a staggering feat of filmmaking.
