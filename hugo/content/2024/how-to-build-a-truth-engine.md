An urgent new documentary on one of the key problems of our time, how to safeguard factual information in a post-truth era of disinformation, conspiracy theories and rapidly changing communications technology. How to Build a Truth Engine assembles a diverse team of contributors from different backgrounds: technology, journalism, folklore and neuroscience. The consensus emerges that if you hack the information feed, you can hack somebody’s mind. We are taken from the information battlefields into the inner workings of the human brain and show how - through us - a web of lies can change reality.
