The A-Frame is a mind-bending sci-fi tale about an ambitious inventor who accidentally discovers a cancer treatment while opening a portal to a subatomic universe. Donna, a young and cynical cancer patient, is preparing for an amputation to stop the disease’s spread. She meets Sam, a stranger who claims to be a quantum physicist with a possible cure. Convinced there may be hope, Donna believes she can help others in her cancer support group. But as events unfold, she begins to question whether she’s offering help—or just recruiting test subjects for Sam’s dangerous experiments.
