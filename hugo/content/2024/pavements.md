Director Alex Ross Perry pushes the boundaries with the music documentary form to bring us the story of the influential cult band Pavement. Pavements combines the standard biographical and archive elements with excerpts from a hit stage musical about the band and an imaginary biopic, deftly staged within the documentary, complete with voice coaching sessions for actor Joe Keery to emulate idiosyncratic vocalist Stephen Malkmus. All the surviving band members appear in the film too, all of which contributes to a multifaceted portrait of a fascinating and complex band with a discography that just seems to get better with age.
