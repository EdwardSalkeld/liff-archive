Rent Free is a fresh and witty American comedy drama exploring a messy and unpredictable queer male friendship. Ben and Jordan are two best friends from Austin, Texas. After their plans of staying in New York self-destruct, they decide to try and spend a whole year not paying rent in their hometown, staying with family, friends and strangers. Their behaviour makes this rent-free challenge even more difficult, and they can’t stay in the same place for long. In his confident second feature, Fernando Andrés nimbly and humorously navigates the ups and down of friendship, work and love.
