## Getting the data

All the data on the site is pulled from the Leeds International Film Festival website or from their published guides and catalogues. This is a mixture of good old fashioned web-scraping, some PDF text extraction scripts and some AI image recognition and bulk formatting.

## Building the site

The site is built in Hugo, from scratch. You can view the source on GitHub (see link in footer!). It is a jumble of markdown, json, toml and templates that compiles down to pure HTML + CSS. Where at all possible there is no JS in this site at all. It should be fast, light and easy to read.

## Hosting the site

TBC but probably a Cloudflare Pages project
