This site is an archive of films shown at the Leeds International Film Festival. It's not in any way official, but is a labour of love.

The [official site](https://www.leedsfilm.com) keeps copies of old catalogues and guides, available as PDFs, but it's not easy to simply browse the historical list of films that have been shown.

This site aims to do that. Hunt down a film you remember by festival strand, year or title.
