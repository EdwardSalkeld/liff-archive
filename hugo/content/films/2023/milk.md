After delivering a stillborn baby, Robin's (rising Dutch star Frida Barnhard) breasts continue to produce milk. With no option but to pump, and conflicted about throwing away the last connection to her lost child, she decides to donate her breast milk to other mothers. Discovering this isn't as simple as she'd hoped, the bottles begin to take over her freezer, her relationship and her life. Premiering at this year's Venice Film Festival, this stunning debut from Stephanie Kolk is an enlightening look at the facets of motherhood and the search for peace after devastating loss.
