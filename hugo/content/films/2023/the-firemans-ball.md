Milos Forman's pitch perfect comedy is a satirical sideswipe at his country's pompous, incompetent bureaucracy and one of the classics of the Czech New Wave. Using an entirely non-professional cast, the film is set during a fundraiser for a small, provincial fire station which turns into a catalogue of disasters. The raffle prize money is stolen, the models are too shy to come out for a beauty contest and the ageing president is constantly thwarted in his attempts to use the bathroom. A unique screening at Gipton's beautifully converted The Old Fire Station.
