Taka is an aimless slacker on the hunt for clues surrounding his brothers' disappearance. A mysterious message soon leads him to the headquarters of the Mad Cats, a murderous cult of cats in human form, hell-bent on taking revenge against unsavoury pet shop owners. After stealing a priceless artifact, he finds himself being pursued by a succession of vicious cat-like women who will stop at nothing to get back what was taken from them in this purr-fectly absurd action-comedy from Japanese director Reiki Tsuno.
