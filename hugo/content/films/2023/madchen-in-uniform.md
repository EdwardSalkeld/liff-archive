A landmark of queer cinema, Leontine Sagan's 1931 classic Madchen in Uniform is a nuanced and tender depiction of a girl who develops romantic feelings for her boarding schoolteacher. Made at the height of the Weimar era, and featuring an all-female cast, the film deftly portrays a world in which lesbian crushes are tolerated, even normalised, but only up to a point.
