Ryusuke Hamaguchi follows up his global arthouse hit Drive My Car with an enigmatic eco-parable, just as thought provoking and elegantly made as its predecessor. In a quiet village close to Tokyo, Takumi and his daughter Hana live a modest life according to the cycles and order of nature. One day, the village inhabitants become aware of a plan to build a glamping site near Takumi's house, offering city residents a comfortable 'escape' to nature. But it soon becomes clear that the plan threatens to disturb this natural equilibrium with problematic consequences for the villagers' lives.
