An impoverished artist loses a winning lottery ticket, and the wheels are set in motion for a dazzling chase across the streets of Paris. This delightful musical comedy from 1931 is a showcase for director Rene Clair's inventive and whimsical storytelling, and his creative use of music and clever stylistic devices influenced the Marx Brothers, Charlie Chaplin, and the genre of the film musical for years to come.
