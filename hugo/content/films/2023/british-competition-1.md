Our first British Short Film Competition is a thrilling exploration of the complexities of relationships, through a superb collection of stories, visuals, and characters. The nature of the relationship varies hugely, from the intense to the mundane, but the impact of our shorts reaches beyond the screen. Through the humorous but heartbreaking Jellyfish and Lobster, we are given insight into a burgeoning new union with transcendental implications. Yet the muted and inconsequential initial meeting of new coworkers gloriously builds into a splendid rebellion, in the subtle yet endearing Care.
