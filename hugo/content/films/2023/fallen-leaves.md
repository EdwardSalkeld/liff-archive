The great Finnish filmmaker Aki Kaurismaki returns with Fallen Leaves, a sublime love story told with his customary deadpan wit and flawless visual style. Fate brings two lonely souls together one night in a melancholy karaoke bar in Helsinki. Ansa is an exploited supermarket worker who can't stand the food waste created by her employers. Holappa is a construction worker who is struggling with a drinking problem. Despite being drawn to each other, various obstacles stand in their way. A profound and heartwarming drama that doubles as a love letter to cinema.
