The first of two free breakfast screenings at LIFF 2023 (Zazie dans le Metro screens on 11 November). An American student (Ethan Hawkes) strikes up a conversation on a train with a young Parisian woman (Julie Delpy) while travelling by Eurail in Austria. On the spur of the moment, he invites her to spend the day with him in Vienna, and a casual acquaintance becomes something more profound. Richard Linklater's beautiful first film in his 'Before' trilogy pays homage to French auteur Eric Rohmer as he lets his characters talk their way into, around and out of each other's affections.
