Nabhaan Rizwaan (Mogul Mowgli, 1917) stars as a struggling British-Asian actor in Naqqash Khalid's debut feature, an inventive satire of the UK film industry. We first meet Aden filming for a role in a generic police drama, though not as the star detective, but as the bloodied corpse on the floor. His self-identity is chipped away at as the film industry offers him nothing but stereotypes and rejections. A talented actor who excels at playing other people, but struggles when playing himself, Aden's perspective is changed when confident Conrad moves in and boundaries between performance and reality blur.
