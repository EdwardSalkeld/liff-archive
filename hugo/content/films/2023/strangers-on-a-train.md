Adapted from Patricia Highsmith's novel released the year before, Strangers on a Train features some of Alfred Hitchcock's most iconic train sequences. The hook is ingenious: two strangers, Bruno and Guy (Farley Granger, Robert Walker), meet on a train and inadvertently agree to 'swap' murders to insure neither of them are implicated. As the plan quickly unravels, revealing startling and exhilarating consequences, Strangers on a Train turns into a breakneck ride of tense thrills that has remained unsurpassed. In fact, you might want to reconsider talking to fellow passengers the next time you journey on public transport.
