Anne is a 30-something New Yorker who balances her unfulfilling corporate job with moonlighting as a sexual 'sub' for men. In a series of awkwardly amusing vignettes, Anne explores the world of BDSM whilst floating through the more mundane aspects of her stagnant life, like arguments with her Jewish family (played by Arnow's real parents) or the decision of which meal to microwave tonight. The talented Joanna Arnow impresses as star, director, screenwriter and editor in this audacious comedy which provides a refreshing take on millennial detachment through a succession of X-rated sketches.
