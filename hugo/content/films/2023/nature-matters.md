Yorkshire Film Archive presents a specially curated selection of films and excerpts made in the region addressing one of the most important issues of our time: the impact of climate and environmental change on our natural landscapes. Screening at St Luke's Cares in Beeston, an old cinema now converted into a charity shop and host to a new Green Film Festival, Nature Matters includes some rediscovered film treasures from South and East Leeds including pieces on local flower contests, Eye on the River Aire and Leeds based hiker John Hawkridge on the right to roam.
