Cult horror comedy Shadow of the Vampire by E. Elias Merhige (who is presenting the film in person in Leeds) reimagines the making of the silent expressionist classic Nosferatu with an ingenious twist. John Malkovitch portrays F.W. Murnau as an impassioned director making a bid for real authenticity by employing the ultimate method actor, Max Schreck (an extraordinary Willem Dafoe), a real vampire who can only work at night. Genuinely creepy but full of irreverent black humour and buckets of blood, Shadow of the Vampire is a macabre delight.
