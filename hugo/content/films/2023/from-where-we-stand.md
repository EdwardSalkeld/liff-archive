Filmmaker Lucy Kaye creates intimate portraits of diverse individuals in three Northern English towns, in this insightful and compassionate documentary. Filmed across Wakefield, Halifax and Middlesbrough, the film brings together stories of loss, migration, friendship, and mutual aid, to convey a strong sense of place and lived experience. Exploring our relationship to the places we live and our sense of belonging, the film challenges stereotypes and gives a vital voice to those not often heard. From Where We Stand is a thoughtfully observed film that feels truly collaborative, and an authentic portrait of Northern England post-Brexit.
