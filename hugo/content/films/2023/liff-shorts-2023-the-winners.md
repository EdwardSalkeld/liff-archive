Always a popular event at LIFF, the winners programme is the culmination of a year of shortlisting and selecting short films from 120 countries to include in our seven competitions. Taking place in the historic setting of Howard Assembly Room, the event will start with the announcement of the winners by the competition juries, and then you can see all the winning films together.
