A love story with a body count. When Cemal, a lonely hearse driver, transports the body of a murdered young woman back to her family he soon discovers that his passenger is not actually dead and instantly begins to fall in love with her. The problem is that she's not exactly alive either. But one thing is for sure, she's hungry, and Cemal will do anything to please her. Turkish director Orcun Behram's second feature film is fantastically twisted, deeply creepy horror that will have you squirming in your seat.
