As every good chef knows, the best kitchens are full of serene and loving concentration. The Taste of Things (previously known as The Pot-au-Feu) immerses us within just such a world of masterly preparation: sauces are patiently reduced, joints of meat are carefully seared, everywhere there is simmering, straining, garnishing, tasting. Renowned gourmet Dodin (Benoit Magimel) masterminds the meals, cook of twenty years Eugenie (Juliette Binoche) carries out his plans. Their closeness in the kitchen sometimes continues to the bedroom. A calming, yearning and sensual delight, this is gorgeous cinema.
