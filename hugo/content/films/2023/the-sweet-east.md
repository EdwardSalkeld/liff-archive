Talia Ryder, Jacob Elordi, Ayo Edibiri and an ensemble of up-and-coming talent star in this electric directorial debut from renowned cinematographer Sean Price Williams (Good Time, Funny Pages). Teenager Lillian gets separated from her classmates during a field trip to Washington DC after a local anarchist saves her from an active-shooter situation. From here, she embarks on a bizarre road trip across America, encountering smug pseudo-intellectuals, insufferable wannabe auteurs and a gang of Neo-Nazis. A scuzzy exploration of the dark side of American culture and contemporary radicalism, executed with a sharply witty script and dreamlike lens.
