From the grimy dance floor of a club the day after the night before, to the not-so-subtle touch of strangers on a bus, we survey the landscape of this burgeoning form. Whether explicitly narrative or more abstract in approach these innovative shorts all share a specific engagement with choreography, offering a fascinating take on this experimental film genre.
