Sometimes even the most mundane of objects can be far more horrific than any monster under the bed. Married couple Jesus and Maria find that out the hard way after buying an ugly, tasteless coffee table for their new home, never anticipating the unthinkable horror it will bring to their lives. Spanish director Caye Casas pulls no punches in this farcical, pitch-black horror comedy that will keep you switching between shock, dread, anxiety and uncontrollable laughter.
