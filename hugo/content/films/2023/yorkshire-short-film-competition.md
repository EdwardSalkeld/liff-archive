Our Yorkshire Short Film Competition is always an absolute treat for the eyes and this year is no exception, as we travel around arguably the best (and most definitely the biggest county), for the opportunity to sample some up and coming, and all-round great home-grown filmmakers. This programme is as varied as they come, providing a glorious tour of genres and styles, but as always, we are thoroughly chuffed with the level of filmmaking coming from our own back yard and we are beyond excited to share it with you.
