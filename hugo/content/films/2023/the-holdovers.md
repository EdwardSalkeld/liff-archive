The latest comedy drama from acclaimed director Alexander Payne (Election, Sideways), The Holdovers is one of the year's new film highlights. Set in the early 1970s, The Holdovers follows a grumpy instructor (Paul Giamatti) at a New England prep school who is forced to remain on campus during Christmas break to babysit the handful of students with nowhere to go. Eventually he forms an unlikely bond with one of them - a damaged, brainy troublemaker (newcomer Dominic Sessa) - and with the school's head cook, who has just lost a son in Vietnam (Da'Vine Joy Randolph).
