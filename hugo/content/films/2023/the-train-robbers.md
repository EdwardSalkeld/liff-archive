Masterfully blending elements of noir and neorealism, Robert Farias' The Train Robbers is a powerful thriller and a searing critique of Brazil's class and racial hierarchy, with the UK Premiere of its 4K restoration presented at LIFF 2023. Based on the true story of a famous train heist in Brazil when a gang led by infamous outlaw Tiao Medonho made off with a small fortune, the film focuses on the aftermath as the gang members split up and try to lay low for a while - but gradually the police close in. Featuring a towering performance from Eliezer Gomes as Medonho in his debut role.
