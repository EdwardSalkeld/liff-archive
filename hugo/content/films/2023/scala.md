London's legendary Scala cinema becomes immortalised in this riotous documentary that lovingly captures its youthful punk spirit. Running from 1978 till 1993, the Scala was infamous for its dynamic programming of cult, trash, classic and experimental cinema. Giving voice to the Scala audience, the film features a stellar array of talking heads, including John Waters, Stewart Lee, Peter Strickland, Mary Harron and Isaac Julien to name a few. With a perfectly sleazy score from Barry Adamson, and a feast of archival film clips, Scala!!! is an evocative tribute to the cinema that continues to inspire new generations of DIY film programmers.
