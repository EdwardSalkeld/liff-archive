Andre and Vera are a young Swedish entrepreneurial couple who get the chance to pitch their women's health app at a prestigious weekend gathering for start-ups and potential investors. Before going, Vera tries hypnotherapy to help her quit smoking, but it has an unexpected side effect: she loses all her social inhibitions, and the weekend doesn't go to plan for her, Andre and the entire gathering. Ernst De Geer's first feature film is a thought-provoking modern satire about trying to be ourselves amid society's expectations and observations of our behaviour.
