A depiction of wartime madness so vivid that it trips into a kind of waking nightmare. At a field hospital in Manchuria, China, casualties are piling high. The Japanese army is immersed in its gruelling WWII invasion and humanity is in short supply. Nurse Nishi (Ayako Wakao) is doing her level best to help her maimed patients, yet the men around her have either regressed to savagery or seek escape through morphine. A thoroughly acerbic anti-war film, a howl of protest made by master stylist Yasuzo Masumura in the same year as The Spider Tattoo.
