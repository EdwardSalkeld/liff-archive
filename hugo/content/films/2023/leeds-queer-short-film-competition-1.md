Leeds Queer Film Festival is honoured once again to be curating the Queer Short Film Competition for LIFF. Since 2005, LQFF has been amplifying queer voices at their own independent festival, and they are always thrilled to see increased LGBTQ+ representation at LIFF. This programme spotlights characters the audience is unlikely to see anywhere else: an Australian First Nations BrotherBoy, a mother who embraces their child's gender identity but struggles to care for them, and a Reggaeton fairy godmother who just wants to help you have a perfect date.
