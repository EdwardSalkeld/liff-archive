An exceptional filmmaking debut from writer/director Ally Pankiw (Feel Good, The Great), featuring a knockout leading performance from rising star Rachel Sennott (Shiva Baby, Bottoms). Sennott stars as Sam Cowell, a stand-up comedian and nanny struggling with PTSD in the aftermath of a trauma. When she learns that Brooke (Olga Petsa), the teenage girl she used to care for has gone missing, Sam's past memories begin to flood her present. Pankiw effectively uses a non-linear narrative to unfold the friendship between Sam and Brooke, and gradually brings Sam's trauma to the surface.
