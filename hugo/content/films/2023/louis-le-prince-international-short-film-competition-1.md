Love and magic collide in this selection of films which zips across the surreal and the sublime to build a wondrous world where life is explored through a dazzling array of events. Rituals and economies, vision and enlightenment, construction and destruction, the Earth's axis and even the passionate poetry of the bolero combine to explore the very deepest mysteries of the heart. From speculative visions of Jakarta to Colombian building sites and extremist convents, this selection of films is truly transnational in every sense.
