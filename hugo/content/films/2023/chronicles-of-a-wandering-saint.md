Elderly chapel keeper Rita is in constant competition with the other women at the church over who is the most saintly, but never seems to win. However, after discovering the town's missing Santa Rita statue, stolen years ago, she sees the opportunity to stage a miracle to prove her devotion, leading to absurd and disastrous results. Featuring a heavenly performance by cult actress Monica Villa, and ingenious use of DJ Sammy's Heaven, this surreal debut by Tomas Gomez Bustillo is a magical exploration of life, death and religion.
