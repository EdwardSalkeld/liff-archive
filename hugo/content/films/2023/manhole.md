Kawamura (Japanese acting and singing idol Yuto Nakajima) is a promising young man with a great job and a fiancee whose father owns the company. But after a few celebratory drinks on the night before his wedding, he falls into a deep manhole. Trapped and horrified by incidents piling up one on top of the other, he becomes desperate to escape, and his phone calls and messages asking for help don't work out as he hopes. Director Kazuyoshi Kumakiri manages to pack his clever, confined thriller with twists and turns throughout.
