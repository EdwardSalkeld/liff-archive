Mona's life - wealthy, Muslim, cosseted - is very different to Julia's - poor, Christian, tough. A few years prior to the south of Sudan's separation, the capital Khartoum was segregated by mutual distrust. Mona accidentally knocks down Julia's young son and, instead of owning up, she drives off and is pursued by Julia's husband Akram, who is now in danger. A story that begins as high-stakes drama morphs into something surprising, gentle and revelatory. Friendship holds these women together, but a secret pushes them apart. This hot debut feature was the first ever film from Sudan to screen in Official Selection at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival.
