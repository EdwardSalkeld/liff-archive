Humans are mutating into beasts, and there is no explanation or cure. We're hurled headlong into the action as Francois and teenage son Emile chase Emile's mother Lara, who is transforming into a 'critter' and is now interned for tests. A man-eagle suddenly bursts from an ambulance, a mass break-out of critters sets off panic. Francois and Emile hide in a forest and search for Mum while widespread prejudice sets in, and Emile has a secret... A wildly inventive mix of body horror, emotional drama and smart speculation.
