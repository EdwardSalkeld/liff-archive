A tapestry of narratives that sensitively capture the elusive sense of place and (be)longing. In this programme, homeland is redefined through the lens of diasporic identities, the search of roots and familial connections, healing journeys into futuristic realms, and quests for meaning in dystopian landscapes. Bold characters confronting threats in their domestic and communal habitats and eventually coming to terms with inevitable change. An invitation to reflect on our own connections to the past, present, and the places we call home.
