1901, on the very southernmost tip of Chile: a pair of brutal soldiers - one a mercenary Texan, the other 'legitimate' Scott, are tasked with opening up a trade route to move cattle from the interior to the ocean. Mixed-race Indigenous marksman Segundo is sent along too, but it emerges that the real reason for for their trip is to wipe out the Indigenous people there. Writer-director Felipe Galvez Haberle has constructed this first feature with great insight into the horrors of colonial conquest. A remarkable and potent vision.
