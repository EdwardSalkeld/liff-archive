Paris Zarcilla's 'coming of rage' debut feature blends horror, drama and childlike fantasy to create a Gothic tale of motherly love, class conflict and palpable fury at systemic prejudice. Joy (Max Eigenmann), an undocumented Filipina immigrant working as a housekeeper, moves herself and her mischievous young daughter Grace (adorable newcomer Jaeden Paige Boadilla) between homes, trying to survive condescension and racism, and all the while saving for a back alley visa. Featuring powerhouse performances from Eigenmann, Boadilla and David Hayman, Raging Grace is a raging, rapturous debut feature film.
