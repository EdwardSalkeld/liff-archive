Returning to LIFF is Queer Fear, which aims to chart queer communities' lasting association with the horror genre. The Hunger remains a rare Hollywood outing for queer representation on screen. Featuring bona fide stars Catherine Deneuve, Susan Sarandon and David Bowie, Tony Scott's directorial debut is a vampire noir that oozes music video cool and 80s neo-Gothic style. Released four decades ago, in an era dominated by slasher flicks, The Hunger was an anomaly. Misunderstood at the time, and perhaps still so today, join us after this 40th anniversary screening for special panel event to discuss this unique film.
