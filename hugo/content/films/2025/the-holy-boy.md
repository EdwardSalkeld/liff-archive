Something sinister lies beneath the picture-perfect aura of a small community in this Italian horror thriller.
Trying to run away from grief, a PE teacher takes a job in a gorgeous mountain village where everyone seems to get along. But it isn’t long before he uncovers the town’s strange rituals and their dire consequences on one particular teenager. The Holy Boy is a thought-provoking exploration of collective trauma and displaced grief from Paolo Strippoli.
