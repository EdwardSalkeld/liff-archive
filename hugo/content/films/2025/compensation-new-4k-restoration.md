An underseen gem, Zeinabu Irene Davis’s Compensation is a tender and original exploration of the Deaf Black American experience.
Set in Chicago, the film weaves two parallel love stories between a Deaf woman and a hearing man, one set at the turn of the century and the other in the 1990s. Using silent film–style intertitles, evocative archival photographs, and inventive descriptive subtitles, Davis crafts a lyrical and affecting meditation on the complexities of love, language and communication.
