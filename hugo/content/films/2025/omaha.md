Two young siblings are taken on a mysterious cross-country journey in this performance-driven debut starring John Magaro (First Cow, Past Lives). 
Awoken by their dad and bustled into their car, Ella and Charlie discover an America they’ve never known. As their road trip unfolds, Ella grows suspicious of her father’s secrecy. Omaha embraces stripped-down intimacy, thriving on an incredible performance by Magaro, debuts from Molly Belle Wright and Wyatt Solis and a quietly impactful screenplay.

Contains upsetting scenes of child abandonment.
