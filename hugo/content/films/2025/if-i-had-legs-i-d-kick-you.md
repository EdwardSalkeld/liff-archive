Led by a virtuoso, Silver Bear–winning performance from Rose Byrne, Mary Bronstein’s If I Had Legs I’d Kick You plunges us into the nightmare of modern motherhood.
As overworked therapist Linda faces her daughter’s mysterious illness, a collapsing home, and an absent husband, her world becomes a relentless pressure cooker of crises. Claustrophobic, darkly funny and unnerving from start to finish, this breathless whirlwind of a film is absolutely not to be missed.

Contains scenes of drug use.
