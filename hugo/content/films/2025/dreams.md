Uncompromising Mexican director Michel Franco reunites with actress Jessica Chastain, whose cold precision powers an erotically charged political drama with a vicious sting in its tail. 
Chastain stars as rich philanthropist Jennifer opposite Isaac Hernández, who plays her lover, a young Mexican ballet dancer Fernando who dreams of international recognition and a life in the US. Believing she will support him, he leaves everything behind but his arrival disrupts her carefully curated world.

Contains themes of sexual violence.
