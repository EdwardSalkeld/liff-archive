An epic survival thriller about a young woman searching for her husband in the aftermath of a terrifying national disaster. 
When an experimental military weapon accidentally devastates Tasmania, volunteers travel to the island to help authorities identify the dead. Among them is Ava (Daisy Ridley), secretly hoping to find her missing husband. But some of the bodies seem to be "waking up". An emotional, dread-building thriller that mixes horror with a tale of loss and our need for closure.

Contains drug use, bloody violence, and frequent depictions of death and grief.
