A weekend to the country changes Yvonne’s life forever when she’s bitten by a tick.
Yvonne is going through a rough time and her friend Camille invites her over for a bit of relaxation. But Yvonne isn’t enthused by the presence of two mysterious guests, who seem overfamiliar and unaware of adequate social boundaries. And to make matters worse, Yvonne gets bitten by a tick and begins to develop strange side effects. Jethica director Pete Ohs crafts a quiet masterclass in millennial malaise.

Contains depictions of grief and bereavement, and some brief references to sexual assualt and brief depictions of bloody violence.
