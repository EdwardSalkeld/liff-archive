From acclaimed Japanese animation production house Studio 4°C, ChaO is a wild romantic comedy and a true ‘fish out of water’ story. 
In a futuristic world where humans and mermaids coexist, ChaO follows Stephan, a mild-mannered office worker at a shipbuilding company, whose life is upended when he is suddenly proposed to by Chao - a princess from the mermaid kingdom. Stephan soon finds himself living with the unpredictable, wholehearted Chao, and an unexpected and touching romance begins to unfold.
