A vital and informative new documentary which sets out to create a deeper understanding of the current state of our food system. 
In Symbiosis systematically tracks how food is produced and distributed and is full of eye opening testimony from perceptive scientists, writers and activists. The film reveals how globalised industrial farming accelerates environmental degradation in response to consumer demand. It also reveals a drive for change and shows a path to sustainability and resilience.
