After The Worst Person in the World, Renate Reinsve reunites with Joachim Trier in his latest Cannes-winning film, also starring Elle Fanning and Stellan Skarsgård.
Nora and Agnes confront old wounds when their director father, Gustav, returns to the family home to shoot a film based on their lives. With actress Nora refusing to take part, Gustav turns his attention to moulding a young American star (Fanning) into his daughter’s role. A masterfully skilled drama featuring Trier’s distinctive humour about grief and the healing power of art.

Contains themes and recreations of suicide.
