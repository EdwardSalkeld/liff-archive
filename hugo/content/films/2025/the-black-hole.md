Otherworldly creatures disrupt the lives of the residents of an apartment block in this delightful Estonian sci-fi triptych.
Aliens, giant spiders, and the malice of men unleash on a quiet neighbourhood when a black hole opens up nearby. Moonika Siimets explores the depths of humanity in this genre-bending deadpan sci-fi comedy, and manages to shine a light on the struggles of modern society - for women and the working class in particular - with humour, tenderness and a charming melancholy.

Contains scenes of domestic violence.
