In Frank Dubosc’s dark comedy, in which he co-stars with Laure Calamy (Call My Agent!), Michel and Cathy lead a quiet but monotonous married life in the mountains. When a bear bursts out in front of Michel’s car, accidentally killing two drug dealers and revealing a €2 million loot in the process, their life takes an unpredictable turn, especially when they decide to cover up the incident and keep the money. But their plan leads them to stumble upon an unexplained trail of dead bodies. More used to being honest than crooked, Michel and Cathy’s clumsy cover-up efforts soon get unwanted attention.
