In Ivana Gloria’s tender and mesmerising fairy tale, green-haired Maia (Sarah Short) is tired of city life and, driven by a desire to be among nature, she decides to spend the summer picking oranges. In the orchards she is greeted by the gardener, an eccentric loner called Teo (Michele Ragno), who notices that Maia isn’t like everyone else. In the same way he tends his plants, he devotes his time and energy to her, too, and the young woman starts to blossom, literally. Their burgeoning friendship, however, is unsettled by the arrival of Teo’s father and older brother Arturo.
