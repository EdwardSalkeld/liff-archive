Join us for the launch of LIFF SHORTS 2024 with a screening of favourites from this year’s short film selection, specially chosen by the programming team. The selection will include team picks from the Louis le Prince, World Animation, Documentary, British, Yorkshire and Queer short film competitions. There will also be an introduction to LIFF SHORTS 2024 and you can pick up our free printed guide for all short films showing this year. Don’t miss the Award Winners event on 9 November at Howard Assembly Room and see if the competition juries selected any of our programming team’s favourites.
