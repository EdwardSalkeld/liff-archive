Join us for our second free breakfast screening to revisit the iconic ‘80s classic film from director John Hughes, with an all-star cast including Molly Ringwald and Emilio Estevez. The Breakfast Club follows five high school students with apparently nothing in common who find themselves frustratingly stuck together in Saturday detention. After initial irritation, they end up sharing stories and gradually realise they may have more in common than they first thought. The Breakfast Club is one of the most memorable coming-of-age stories on film that still resonates with audiences today.
