Always a popular event at LIFF, the Award Winners is the culmination of a year of shortlisting and selecting short films from over 120 countries to include in our eight competitions. Taking place in the historic setting of Howard Assembly Room on 9 November, the event starts with the announcement of the award winners by the competition juries, and then all the winning films are screened together. The duration of the event depends on the length of the winning films, but it is normally around 90 minutes. The programme of winning films is repeated twice at Everyman on 14 November.
