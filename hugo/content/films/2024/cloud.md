Kiyoshi Kurosawa has one of the most extensive filmographies in modern Japanese cinema, including ‘90s cult classics like Cure and Pulse, and multi-award-winning dramas like Tokyo Sonata from 2008. Kurosawa has added three more films to his filmography alone in 2024, and his third Cloud was launched at Venice and Toronto film festivals. Cloud is a suspenseful thriller in which a young internet reseller, Ryosuke Yoshii (Masaki Suda) ignites a cyber-fuelled storm of malice. Blurring digital and physical threats, Cloud is a chilling dive into the dark side of modern connectivity.
