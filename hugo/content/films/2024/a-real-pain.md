A whip smart road movie, blending rapid fire comedy with poignant emotional drama, A Real Pain marks out Jesse Eisenberg as a great director as well as an accomplished actor. He stars alongside Kieran Culkin as odd couple Jewish cousins, David and Benji, getting back together for a tour through Poland to honour their beloved grandmother, a Holocaust survivor. David is an uptight, responsible family man and Benji is a slacker and a motormouth, quick witted but entirely lacking a filter. A deftly balanced film of genuine wit and wisdom.
