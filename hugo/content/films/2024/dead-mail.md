This surreal horror thriller blends retro analogue aesthetics with a twisted tale of obsession, murder, and electronic keyboards. In a 1980s Midwestern post office, a bloodstained letter arrives with a desperate plea for help from someone claiming to be kidnapped but without any clear address. The mysterious letter catches the eye of Jasper, a ‘dead mail’ expert, who begins trying to trace the source. But someone else is trying to hunt down the letter, determined to keep his dark secret hidden and recover the letter at any cost.
