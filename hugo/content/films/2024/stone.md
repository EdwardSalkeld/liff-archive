Australia’s bike gangs are known for their steadfast loyalty and outlaw status. Stone, a precursor to Mad Max, is very much their movie. In Sydney, members of the Satan-worshipping Gravediggers gang are being assassinated. Undercover cop Stone poses as a bikie member of the gang to infiltrate the scene and investigate the killings. Among a vivid ensemble cast, Stone features Hugh Keays-Byrne, later to appear as both The Toecutter and Immortan Joe in Mad Maxes 1 and 4. He helps create an arcane psychedelic subcultural scene in which the gang is everything, totally separate from straight society.
