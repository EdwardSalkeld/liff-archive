Ketan Mehta’s Mirch Masala is set in India during British colonial rule. The film portrays the struggles of women in a small, traditional village, detailing the patriarchal oppression they face. The backdrop of the story focuses on a system of colonial officials, embodied by a tax collector (Naseeruddin Shah), and the resistance of local women, particularly around the spice factory where they work. Where resistance comes most forthright is in the iconic figure of Sonbai played by Smita Patil in what was arguably her most iconic role, imbuing the film with a memorable feminist and anti-colonial power.
