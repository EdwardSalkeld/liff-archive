For the general population in straight-laced 1950s Melbourne there were two rampant scourges that supposedly threatened civilisation: Communism, and rabbits. Young Celia has affiliations to both; her recently departed grandma was a Communist, so is the next-door neighbour, and Celia nags her uptight dad for a bunny of her own. Celia’s horror-tinged fantasies help her process an adult world which she finds bizarre, and eventually the violence of her dreams starts to creep into the real world. Director Ann Turner’s debut feature is a highly distinctive mix of social drama and fantasy, a quizzical view of Australian conformity.
