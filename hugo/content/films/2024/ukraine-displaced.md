In this special short film programme, we bring you a selection of powerful stories of displacement and resilience from filmmakers working inside and outside of Ukraine. These films thoughtfully explore the emotional journeys of individuals forced to escape the devastation of war, highlighting the experience of being thrust into a new life unwillingly. From Ukrainian children exploring their new home in a former German military barracks to a young woman returning to Kyiv to see her family, these tender and poignant films examine the struggles of adjusting to unfamiliar circumstances while striving to maintain a connection to one’s home.
