Roman Bondarchuk's inventive satirical drama skewers post-truth politics
in Ukraine in the days before the Russian invasion. Yura, a young biologist
searching for an endangered species of marmot on the wild steppes
of Southern Ukraine, witnesses arsonists starting a forest fire. Taking his
photographs to the editorial office of the local newspaper, he realises
that no one is interested in pursuing justice. His worldview is upended by
encounters with fake news, electoral fraud and cryptocurrency get-rich
schemes and all the while, war is looming on the horizon.
