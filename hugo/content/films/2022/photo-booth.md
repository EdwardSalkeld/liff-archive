Roxy Rezvany, an independent British artist filmmaker of Iranian-Malaysian-Chinese descent celebrates marginalised narratives whilst exploring themes of family, home and belonging through a refreshing and insightful romantic comedy drama about an immigrant couple in 1970s London, and their relationship navigating both Britain's immigration laws and each other.
