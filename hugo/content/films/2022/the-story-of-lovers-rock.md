Lovers Rock, often dubbed 'romantic reggae', is a uniquely black British sound that developed in the late 70s and 80s against a backdrop of racism, uprisings and sound systems. Shining a light on a forgotten period in British music, social and political history, the recently passed Menelik Shabazz's documentary feature underlines the impact Lovers Rock made in bridging the multi-cultural gap that polarised Thatcher's nation. With a fantastic list of contributors, archive footage and witty reconstruction, this outstanding film gives us one of the great untold tales of Jamaican-UK connection. Screening with Jamaican short film Sugarcake.

> To make it for the cinema I needed to add other elements other than talking heads and music. I added two other elements, the first being humour. Experiencing the reggae party/blues/dance scene, I recognised elements that had the potential for humour - from sneaking out, the styles, dance etc... so I assembled comedians who could bring that aspect. The second element was the dance itself. It had to be reminiscent - it couldn't be just middle-aged people talking about it. With this dance we had to see it, experience it and it had to take you back to that feeling as young people.
