Following Alfie Barker's acclaimed short Hanging On (LIFF35), This touching drama was created with associate director and Leeds-based artist, Masego Lynia. Inspired by a true story, Malaika and her two children take shelter in a swimming pool, and try to overcome their recent trauma, in the after-hours of their impermanent home.
