quote = "Finite tackles an issue which impacts us all, the climate crisis and our addiction to fossil fuels which is pushing us to disaster. But crucially, despite the ubiquity of this issue, [the film] is an insight into a world that few of us are truly engaged with - the frontline battle between ordinary people and fossil fuel companies. Importantly, the film gives us hope for how the tide can be turned against climate breakdown; not with naive optimism, but by laying bare what is possible with collective action, because hope is action. If you're anxious about the climate crisis - (let's face it, who isn't?) - then you need to watch this film."

Finite: The Climate of Change is an urgent and inspiring documentary made on the frontline of climate activism. In Germany, concerned citizens step forward to save an ancient forest from one of Europe's largest coal mines. They form an unlikely alliance with a frustrated community in rural England who are forced into action to protect their homes from a new opencast coal mine. Finite is an insider's view of the world of direct action; a raw, authentic and emotional insight into the David and Goliath battle between frontline communities, activists and fossil fuel corporations.
