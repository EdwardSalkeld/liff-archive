In this experimental cinematic portrait, South African mother, full-time domestic worker and part-time actor, Mothiba Grace Bapela, reflects on her extraordinary life, and searches for a way to break out of the societal roles cast for her. Director Lindiwe Matshikiza leads an multidisciplinary creative process in producing this collaboratively-made portrait of the often precarious, sometimes miraculous position of an African female migrant worker. One Take Grace is a vibrant and powerful display of a captivating woman and an incredible life story.

The collaboration between artist, Lindiwe Matshikiza (39), and actor and community leader, Mothiba Grace Bapela (58) began with the two women meeting as actors on a local film set in 2010. Lindiwe was struck by Mme Bapela's reflections on her life, and on the conflict of needing steady - if poorly paid - domestic work. That first encounter started a process of collaboration lasting over a decade, with Lindiwe following Mme Bapela around- sometimes with the help of friends with equipment, sometimes alone, with whatever was on hand - recording her day-to-day life and past experiences. Through this deeply intimate project, a portrait of both the woman and the country begins to emerge, with certain questions being asked: How are the roles of our dysfunctional society dished out? Who's doing the casting? What kind of set is this??
