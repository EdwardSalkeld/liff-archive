Animator Hagar Faibish's distinctively outlandish style is the perfect accompaniment to this humorously melancholic tale, set in a dystopian existence of televisual, media-saturated ennui. It's a surreal film, yet grounded in our modern world - which is the correct key to free your mind from relentless consumerism, religion and social conformity?
