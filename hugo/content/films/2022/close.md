Léo and Rémi are close. They are thirteen-year-old boys who have grown up in each other's company, completely sharing and trusting. It's a childhood utopia, but one that can be vulnerable. Returning to school after an idyllic summer together, the boys' friendship attracts gossip among their peers. And now with an emerging 'image' to protect, Léo begins to push Rémi away. The second film by Lukas Dhont (Girl, LIFF 2018) is another masterpiece of poignant naturalism and sympathy. Winner of the Grand Prix at Cannes 2022.

> [the film] started from a very personal place. Growing up, I had a lot of male friends between 13 and 18 that I lost because of who I am. Because I was so scared of intimacy with another boy, who I was and the label of the sexuality [I had], I started to fear some friendships and let some go … In a way, I think I made this film for friends I lost. I got a message from one saying they heard this film exists and wanted to reach out. That may be a beautiful thing that happens through releasing this.
