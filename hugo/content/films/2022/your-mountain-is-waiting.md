Numbed by her inner-city life, Martha has become ambivalent to her surroundings, until a strange drink and a chance encounter lead her, and a new companion to discover surreal and beautiful inner worlds. Director and designer Hannah Jacobs has created a delightful and playful film about the possibilities of transcendence.
