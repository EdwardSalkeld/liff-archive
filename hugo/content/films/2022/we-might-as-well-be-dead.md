quote = "It all started with the high-rise building that we picked for our location. I grew up in a high-rise myself, and those kinds of buildings really fascinate me. People live in close quarters but in total anonymity. It's quite exciting to observe how they behave and how they interact with each other in the lift or the staircase. So we had our location, and when we were developing the script with my co-writer, Viktor Gallandi, a story slowly emerged around the question of fear: fear of the unfamiliar, but also fear of others."
