Shot from multiple viewpoints in a remote Scottish glen, this film reveals the pleasures and challenges of neurodiverse responses to nature and shared experience. It reveals the subtle fluidity of roles and interactions between this unique and itinerant community away from the practical, attitudinal and social barriers of everyday life.
