Pallavi Agarwala is an animator from New Delhi. She started this film while studying in London, inspired by her many encounters with military statues around the capitol. Archive materials meet scything humour with a brilliantly original technique, which has echoes of an artistic tradition that includes Peter Kennard and Banksy.
