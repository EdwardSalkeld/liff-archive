30-year-old Kao is the world's fastest sport stacker, thanks in large part to his self-sacrificing girlfriend Jay, who allows him to practice nonstop. When she comes to her senses and leaves, he must face reality, grow up and build a new support system to reach his goal - as well as win her back. Director Nawapol Thamrongrattanarit has crafted a thrill-a-minute romcom/stacking-action tale that is as fast moving and quirky as the oddball sport at the centre of its plot. Throbbing with energy, ingenuity and originality, this spirited send-up of young adulthood is a mesmerizing showstopper. (New York Asian Film Festival)

> My main concern with the film was to explore the daily life of the superhero who is growing up or needs to grow up. The meaning of the superhero to me is an ordinary person who is very good at doing something. So I have to find the occupation of the main character, what is the superpower in their life. I started with an athlete, someone who's running fastest. I explored more and more until I found sports stacking. I watched video clips of the sport stackers and they were very fast: they finished stacking within four seconds! And to me it's kind of like a special ability, like, How can you do that? It's so amazing. I thought, It's the right thing for the film. So I chose cup stacking or sports stacking.
