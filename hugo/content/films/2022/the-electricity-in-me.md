Centred around a riveting, one-take monologue from Ellora Torchia (Ali & Ava, In The Earth), this composed and compelling portrait is based on the diaries and letters of the director's mother. After giving up her newborn for adoption, she confronts her trauma and memories of the man she calls 'my monster'.
