Cecilie McNair, previous recipient of a Young Directors Award for best student short film at Cannes, presents her haunting feature debut, a psychological drama that explores the range of emotions that come with involuntary childlessness. Hannah, a young fertility doctor, longs to carry a baby but is struggling to get pregnant herself. After meeting an older patient who is fertile but above the legal age for treatment, Hannah's ethical and moral boundaries are questioned. Driven by jealousy and powerlessness, how far is she willing to go to make her greatest wish come true?

> With Baby Pyramid, I want to take the audience on a nerve-wracking journey into a fascinating and exotic environment, just as I want to raise a number of complex ethical dilemmas. Baby Pyramid is a story about the basic needs of humans, which Maslow's pyramid of needs defines, and this is where the inspiration for the title comes from. It is about the longing to reproduce and about the powerlessness that arises from not knowing some of the most animalistic and basic - creating new life… With Baby Pyramid, I want to create a more radical and fatal narrative about childlessness, which can hopefully provide an insight into some of the unreasonably difficult and taboo emotions one goes through as an involuntarily childless person.
