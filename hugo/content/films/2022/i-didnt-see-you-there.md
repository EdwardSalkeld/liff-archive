I really just wanted to show how a disabled person does - or does not - fit into society, and how disabled people need to adapt to be \"palatable\" to society. I wanted to present an approximate version of my vision, without giving viewers the \"satisfaction\" of looking at me. [...] This isn't an autobiography. This is a film about me in a specific place and time - or, I should say, a version of me that doesn't exist in real life. It's a specific version that you see on-screen."

I Didn't See You There is an innovative, expressionistic and deeply personal film, and the debut documentary feature by filmmaker Reid Davenport. Shot entirely from first-person perspective, with a camera affixed to the filmmaker's electric wheelchair, Davenport immerses the viewer in his point of view, narrating his daily journeys, and the indignities of traversing the world in a wheelchair. When a looming circus tent is erected in his Oakland neighbourhood, Reid is compelled to reflect on the damaging legacy of the circus freak show and its framing of disability as spectacle.
