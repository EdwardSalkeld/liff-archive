Two teenagers with a tender friendship experience a tragic evening. What follows is a fractured retelling of that night, a single, fateful moment in time, seen from two perspectives. A disturbing study of implicit bias, beautifully animated by Robert-Jonathan Koeyers, recent graduate of Rotterdam's Willem de Kooning Academy.
