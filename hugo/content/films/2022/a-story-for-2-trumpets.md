It's no surprise this charming animation has been snapped up by the ever-reliable Miyu Distribution. It's a spectacular, watery watercolour tale of surreal beauty. A childhood fantasy where we meet a pipe-playing goose, strange sea-creatures, and cheeky babies, on a colourful journey of a girl becoming a woman and artist.
