One of the best graduation films you're likely to see, Andrea Szelesová's affecting animation has a gentle simplicity that allows for a variety of allegorical readings. In a film about dependency and the difficulty of letting go, a little girl takes care of her gigantic sister, trapped in the middle of a deserted land.
