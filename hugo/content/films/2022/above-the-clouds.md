There is a fluid kind of storytelling that can only be realised with animation. As we flip from reality to imagination, and back again, we feel our heroine's palpitations, her heart in her mouth. The subject? Love of course. Hungarian filmmaker Vivien Hárshegyi brilliantly captures its contradictory nature.
