Capturing the spirit of youth, Lula Ali Ismaïl's vibrant debut feature follows three friends growing up in Djibouti. Coming from different socio-economic backgrounds, the film reveals the pressures that young women face and the choices they have to make. This film is an exuberant portrait of a city blending modernity and tradition. Lula Ali Ismaïl is part of a small group of talented Djiboutian filmmakers who are growing an emerging film industry, also in its youth. Presented in partnership with Cinema Africa! A new permanent film strand at Hyde Park Picture House, celebrating the rich variety of African lives and cultures, for all Leeds audiences.

> This is a Djiboutian story- an African story- with universal appeal. I wanted to portray as close as possible an image of what it's like to be a 17 or 18 year old in Djibouti, first and foremost for the people of Djibouti. People want their stories told by one of them. When the film was screened in the country, the audience were happy to see streets they recognised; their day-to-day lives on the screen. And that's why I say, this is a film owned by the people of Djibouti- they made it happen. Djibouti has a lot of stories that need to be told. It is my hope to see us have our own film industry.
