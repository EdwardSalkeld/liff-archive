quote = "In Korea, showing blood or violence is not that easy. It's rather limited by the audience reaction, and shy away from excessive use of either. You can almost call it a taboo. I knew that, so I discussed it with the investors and production companies, and they said they approved of the level of violence I wanted to express in my film. We created new blood pumps, and my intention was to do something as real or even more real than what Tarantino does. As you know, blood does not just seep out. If you cut an artery, it might pump out. That's what I wanted, so I'm happy. I understand that some of my audience is not so happy, but fortunately, I am happy."

When efforts to extradite notorious convicts from the Philippines to South Korea are stymied by a deadly airport bombing, the Korean authorities commandeer the cargo freighter Frontier Wolf for their next transfer. As a rogues' gallery of lowlifes, including a callous heir to a criminal empire (Seo In-guk), board the titanic vessel, they are escorted by two dozen hardened detectives, and the vigilant oversight of a hot-headed Coast Guard captain (Sung Dong-il). Despite the heavy security, a plot to seize control of the ship percolates among the prisoners and soon boils over, but what neither cop nor crook appear to be privy to is that they are not the freighter's only cargo...
