quote = "I am a filmmaker who has a melancholic state of mind along with a sense of humour. This led me to write a thriller-drama about Waleed, a 40-year-old aspiring writer suffering from chronic depression. Through this fictional male character, I pushed my opinions and daily thoughts to extremes. I know Waleed's character and I am familiar with it. I developed a mockery of my dark side through a person that is similar yet different from me. While playing with life and death themes, I took Waleed to extremes that I never would have dared to reach… I chose to focus on one personality and express the depression of an individual, in contrast to that of an entire society."

Palestinian filmmaker Maha Haj won Best Screenplay in Un Certain Regard at Cannes 2022 for her bittersweet and unpredictable comedy-drama about male friendship. Middle-aged, melancholic, and married with two kids, Waleed has abandoned a steady job in banking to pursue his dream of becoming a writer. But his novel and his life in the seaside city of Haifa seem to be going nowhere. That is until he meets Jalal, a fellow Palestinian and the laid-back father of a family that's just moved in next door. An initially tense meeting develops into a friendship that might just help Waleed get his writing and his life back on track.
