 I would like you to proceed step-by-step wih CONVERSION_PLAN_2023.md .
  Before each step, read learnings.md. Then do the step, mark it as
  complete, and update learnings.md with any useful context that will
  help subsequent steps. You can update the plan if anything you learn
  changes future steps, but you don't have to. Then pause.
