    "description": "In this wildly comedic, time-traveling adventure an eccentric inventor embarks on a quest to unravel the mystery of time – mostly because he’s bored. Mad scientist Tim Travers has built a time machine to test a paradox: can you really travel two minutes back in time and kill your younger self? When the experiment fails he decides to team up with his younger versions to solve the paradox while evading gangsters (lead by Danny Trejo) trying to retrieve their stolen plutonium.",
