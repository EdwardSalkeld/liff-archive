    "description": "Composer Margherita Vicario’s joyful debut feature is a soaring musical reimagining of history that tells the story of a group of young women musicians who invent pop music in 18th century Venice. Gloria! is set in a convent boarding school for girls and follows Teresa who has visionary musical abilities but whose gift remains unsung. Together with other extraordinary young women musicians, Teresa breaks through and leaps across the centuries to defy the dusty old regime by inventing a rebellious, light, and modern music: pop! A shoutout to the erased history of women in music.",
