    "description": "Rising cult filmmaker Kenichi Ugana’s offbeat, lo-fi The Gesuidouz is the story of a misfit horror-themed punk band that moves to the Japanese countryside to write the greatest punk anthem in the world. Hanako has a dream: her band The Gesuidouz will perform at Glastonbury Festival and that, just like her heroes Jim Morrison and Kurt Cobain, she will die at 27. With a year left until her deadline, Hanako makes a desperate appeal with a power drill to her apathetic manager’s cranium, and he offers the band a rural farm where they can buckle down and focus on writing a bonafide hit.",
