    "description": "Roman Bondarchuk's inventive satirical drama skewers post-truth politics\nin Ukraine in the days before the Russian invasion. Yura, a young biologist\nsearching for an endangered species of marmot on the wild steppes\nof Southern Ukraine, witnesses arsonists starting a forest fire. Taking his\nphotographs to the editorial office of the local newspaper, he realises\nthat no one is interested in pursuing justice. His worldview is upended by\nencounters with fake news, electoral fraud and cryptocurrency get-rich\nschemes and all the while, war is looming on the horizon.",
