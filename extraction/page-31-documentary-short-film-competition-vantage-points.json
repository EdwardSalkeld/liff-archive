    "description": "In the first ever competition programme for documentary short films at LIFF we traverse five continents, reach into the past, race through the present, and peer into the future. Observe cities from unfinished tower blocks, as bodies of water, and through maps of militant bombing sites. Delve into the mind of a child who yearns to squeeze reality, another trapped in the past, and a woman with strange dreams of American cryptographer Hal Finney. Including experiments with collective filmmaking, psychogeography and mixed material techniques, our selection offers an expansive view of what documentaries can be.",
