    "description": "French writer-director Simon Bouisson brings the haunting and unsettling immersion of his interactive TV thrillers to his first feature film Drone. Émilie has just arrived in Paris to study, secretly working nights as a cam girl to make ends meet. One evening, a drone appears at her apartment window. From then on, whenever she is alone, the drone appears and follows her. Émilie is initially intrigued about who is hiding behind this machine and starts to form an unconventional relationship with it. When she eventually tries to escape the drone’s grip, the trap closes in on her.",
