    "description": "Eleven years in the making, this deliberately trashy, DIY musical splatterfest recently won Best Picture in Horror Features at Fantastic Film Fest. Hopeless romantics Maria and Tom have just fallen in love when they find themselves on the run from a blood-soaked chainsaw killer. After Maria is kidnapped, it’s up to Tom to rescue her, with the help of Jaan, an eccentric stranger he meets along the way. With absurdist humour, cartoon logic, and plenty of gore, this film is destined to become a cult classic with genre fans after making waves in the festival circuit.",
