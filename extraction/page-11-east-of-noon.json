    "description": "East of Noon is a vividly imaginative Egyptian fable and a\nclever political satire, beautifully shot in luminous black and\nwhite 16mm. Hala Elkoussy's second feature is set in a confined,\nisolated community where the citizens are subject to a bizarre\nand oppressive dictatorship. Shawky is an eccentric old showman\nwho rules with a mix of performance and fear, while Abdo is\na teenage prodigy who uses music to rebel against his elders,\nand storyteller Jalala provides relief with stories of the Sea.\nEast of Noon is a sumptuous cinematic spectacle.",
