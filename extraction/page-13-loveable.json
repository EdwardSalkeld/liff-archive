    "description": "Years after a whirlwind second marriage, Maria (Helga Guren) finds herself lost and confused when her husband (Oddgeir Thunn) files for divorce. As she struggles to understand what went wrong, everyone around her - her ex, her children, and even her mother – gives her the impression that she was the cause. Featuring an outstanding, vulnerable performance from Guren, Lilja Ingolfsdottir’s debut feature takes a fresh and nuanced approach to contemporary ideas of romance, relationship equality, and the power of womanhood.",
