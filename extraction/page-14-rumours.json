    "description": "The US election will dominate the news in November, and while you’re escaping from it all at LIFF, don’t miss this wildly entertaining sci-fi satire about an earth-threatening encounter of world leaders at a G7 summit with undead bog people and a giant brain. As the leaders gather alone by a lake on a German countryside estate to prepare their joint statement, they lose all communication with the rest of the world as a thick fog descends. Co-produced by Ari Aster and co-directed by Guy Maddin, Rumours stars Cate Blanchett as German Chancellor and Charles Dance as US President.",
