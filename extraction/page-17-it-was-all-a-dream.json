    "description": "A powerful memoir constructed from the personal archive of leading director and music journalist dream hampton, It Was All a Dream shines a light on the early hip hop scene through a Black feminist lens. From the studio to the street, filmed on handheld cameras, the film gives intimate access to some of the biggest names in hip hop including The Notorious BIG, Wu Tang’s Method Man, Mobb Deep, Snoop Dogg, and many more. Hampton’s narration gives a fresh insight into a key musical genre, reframing the way it is viewed and its treatment of women.",
