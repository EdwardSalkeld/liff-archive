    "description": "The paranoia of a sexless couple's relationship is explored through a\ncollage of surveillance video in this absurd dark comedy from Eugene\nKotlyarenko (Spree, Wobble Palace). Early-pandemic, Jay and Celine\n(Peter Vack and Dasha Nekrasova) head to a rental house to reconnect.\nWhile Celine films a documentary on their disintegrating relationship,\na recently 'cancelled' Jay becomes increasingly paranoid about his\nportrayal, setting up hidden cameras to spy on Celine. Using footage\nfrom over 70 cameras, memes and TikTok reels, Kotlyarenko presents\na voyeuristic exploration of the attention economy and our vapid\nrelationship with technology in a staggering feat of filmmaking.",
