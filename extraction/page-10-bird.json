    "description": "Andrea Arnold (Fish Tank, American Honey) returns to LIFF with an enchanting social drama. Trapped in a squat with her hapless father (Barry Keoghan), Bailey (Nykiya Adams) often escapes to the fields surrounding her estate to comfort herself in nature. After her dad announces he’s marrying his new girlfriend, and also milking a toad of its psychedelic bodily fluids to pay for the wedding, she encounters the ethereal Bird (Franz Rogowski) in the fields searching for his long-lost family. As the two connect through their lack of familial roots, Bailey finds strength to confront the violence in her life and discovers her wings.",
