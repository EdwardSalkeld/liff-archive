    "description": "Norwegian auteur Dag Johan Haugerud places male sexuality and identity under the microscope in this candid and thought-provoking comedy drama. Set in contemporary Oslo, the film centres on two friends who work as chimney sweeps, both married and ostensibly heterosexual. During a casual coffee break chat, one reveals that he had sex with a male client, while the other confesses to recurring dreams where he is perceived as a woman. These disclosures lead them to unexpectedly confront their sexual identities. This first part of the ‘Sex Dreams Love’ trilogy provides thoughtful, refreshing, and humourous interrogation of heteronormativity.",
