    "description": "A unique and innovative fiction-documentary by pioneering filmmaker William Greaves that breaks filmmaking conventions and storytelling boundaries. Overlooked when first realised, it is now considered an iconic work and championed by Steve Buscemi and Steven Soderbergh. Set in New York’s Central Park, a film crew headed by Greaves try and figure out what film they are making, slipping in front and behind the camera, and through different genres. Screening as part of the Stuart Croft season with the artist’s short film The Death Waltz in which a guest at a dinner party recites an endless, gothic ghost story.",
