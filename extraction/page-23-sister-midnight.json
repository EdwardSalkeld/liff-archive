    "description": "Karan Kandhari’s debut feature Sister Midnight is a genre-bending comedy about a frustrated, misanthropic newlywed who discovers certain feral impulses that land her in unlikely situations. A newly arranged marriage. An oddball couple shoved together in a small Mumbai shack with paper-thin walls. Unpredictable Uma does her best to cope with the heat, her total lack of domestic skills, nosy neighbours, and her bumbling spouse until the nocturnal world of Bombay lead her to face her own strange behaviours.",
