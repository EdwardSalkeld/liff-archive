    "description": "The standout first feature film from director Leonardo Van Dijl is the gripping story of Julie (Tessa Van den Broeck, stunning in her first role), a star player at an elite tennis academy in Belgium whose coach is suspended after allegations of abuse. The players and staff are all encouraged to give evidence, while Julie decides to stay quiet. Her decision and struggle with the truth are reflected in the muted cinematography, and a haunting score plays out alongside the back and forth of the tennis court. Leonardo Van Dijl expertly crafts his film through silence and absence to portray Julie’s trauma.",
