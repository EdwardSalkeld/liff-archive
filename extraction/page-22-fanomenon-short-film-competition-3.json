An A.I.’s assistance turns into chaos, a man’s encounter with a missing woman has him pondering his own existence, whilst a woman wakes up to a disturbing figure stalking her apartment. Elsewhere, 65-year-old Lucita is dying to visit her son in hell, while a couple hides from a menacing group in a Twilight Zone-like world. On a burnt-up Earth, a mother must confront the strange changes affecting her son, and finally, a husband’s breakthrough in reaching his catatonic wife has disturbing consequences.",
