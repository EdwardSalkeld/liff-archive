    "description": "This year we are delighted to present two cult animated features by director René Laloux, Fantastic Planet and Time Masters. Nothing else has ever looked or felt like Laloux’s surreal animated marvel Fantastic Planet, a politically minded and visually inventive work of science fiction, with a brilliant psychedelic jazz score by Alain Goraguer. The film is set on a distant planet called Ygam, where enslaved humans (Oms) are the playthings of giant blue native inhabitants (Draags). After Terr, kept as a pet since infancy, escapes from his gigantic child captor, he is swept up by a band of radical fellow Oms who are resisting the Draags’ oppression and violence.",
