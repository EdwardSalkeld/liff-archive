    "description": "Mike Leigh returns with an unflinching and darkly humorous portrait of a woman full of fury and teetering on the edge. Marianne Jean-Baptiste (Oscar-nominated for Secrets & Lies) gives an outstanding central performance as Pansy, a woman whose emotional and physical health issues have spiralled into deep, uncontrollable anger. This rage affects everyone around her—from her husband and grown-up son to her doctor, dentist and supermarket cashier. In contrast, Pansy’s sister Chantelle is a compassionate spirit who balances her struggles with the ability to find and embrace joy. Hard Truths is a candid yet moving and empathetic portrayal of untreated suffering.",
