    "description": "Unveiling temporal realities from diverse corners of the globe, our third programme captures the universal challenge of accepting differences. The theme emerges from complex familial, societal, historical, religious, and political relationships woven throughout the films. Sensitive yet daring Amarela and Takeaway illustrate the struggles of navigating cultural appreciation and appropriation in an alienating environment. An Orange from Jaffa confronts entrenched antagonisms, underscoring the vital need to coexist and reconnect on a human level. Together, selected stories offer a compelling cinematic commentary on our collective journey toward understanding and acceptance.",
