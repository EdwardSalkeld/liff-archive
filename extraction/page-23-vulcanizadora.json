    "description": "Director Joel Potrykus presents a darkly comedic and unpredictable exploration of two aging slackers intent on carrying out a disturbing pact on a camping trip. Martin and his man-child friend Derick wander through the woods, armed with fireworks, glowsticks and a mysterious metal contraption. As ill-equipped for survival as they are for the world itself, their pact soon unravels and one of them has to face the consequences. Shot on 16mm, Vulcanizadora blends Potrykus’ signature “metal slackerism” with offbeat dark humour focused on outcasts and misfits.",
