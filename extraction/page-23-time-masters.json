    "description": "Directed by visionary animator René Laloux and designed by the legendary Jean Giraud (a.k.a. Moebius), Time Masters is a visually fantastic foray into existentialist space adventure, presented in its new 4K restoration. After his parents are killed on the dangerous planet Perdide, young Piel survives by maintaining radio contact with Jaffar, a pilot transporting the exiled Prince Matton and Princess Belle. Along the way, they encounter the Time Masters, mysterious beings who can bend reality and reveal to the heroes their secret origins and destinies.",
