    "description": "RaMell Ross, director of the beautiful Hale County, This Morning, This Evening directs this deeply moving adaptation of Colson Whitehead’s Pulitzer Prize winning novel. The Nickel Academy is a brutal reformatory for troubled teens in the Southern States in the early 60s where the Jim Crow laws of racial segregation still hold sway. Two young men form an alliance there. The clever, idealistic newcomer Elwood gets survival tips from the toughened and savvy Turner. Far removed from the Civil Rights Movement, they find their own ways to face up against a savagely oppressive system.",
