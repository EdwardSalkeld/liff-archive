    "description": "Winner of the 2024 Cannes Grand Prix, Payal Kapadia’s sophomore feature is a luminous portrait of the lives, loves, and longings of three women in Mumbai. Prabha and Anu are roommates and nurses working at Mumbai Hospital. Prabha throws herself into her work, a distraction from the fact that her husband living abroad hasn’t called in over a year. Anu cultivates a clandestine romance with her Muslim boyfriend, while hospital cook Parvaty returns to her village after being forced out by property developers. With exquisite cinematography and captivating performances, All We Imagine as Light is a heartfelt and poetic depiction of hope, desire and sisterhood.",
