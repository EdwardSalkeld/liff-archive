  "description": "Going back to where it all started: Jamaica's lush country interior. This is where Jamaican music began and to where Inna de Yard returns; to capture the music 'in its virgin state'. Re-recording their classic songs in acoustic, roots-y new versions are reggae heroes Cedric Myton, Kiddus I (Rockers), Winston Mcanuff and Ken Boothe. Together they form a kind of reggae soul supergroup, and wax lyrical about how creativity can always be re-charged by returning to country. Climaxing in a joyful Paris concert, this is a document of the essence of Jamaican culture. Screening with Jamaican dance short Hot Gyal.",

    "text": "[As an] old fan of this music, it was with enthusiasm that I recently traveled to Jamaica to meet some of my idols of the time, in great shape and still active. The excitement of approaching these musicians, of listening to their story of their very beginnings, when the scene was in its infancy, how they survived the lean years that followed, and then their comeback, in recent years, was very inspiring. ...This very personal project filled me with enthusiasm and passion. It took me back to the teenager I once was - a kid who saved his pocket money to go find the latest Jamaican sounds on [London's] All Saints Road.",
