  "description": "The astonishing story behind one of Detroit's great contributions to world culture: Techno, the electronic-music phenomenon created by black artists in the 1980s that transformed dance music internationally and blossomed into the multibillion-dollar industry of EDM today. Featuring interviews with Jeff Mills, Kevin Saunderson, Juan Atkins, Derrick May, among many more, this is a vast, compelling and highly educative cultural history of techno and musical innovation, of heritage and the people responsible for that heritage, with the city of Detroit at its very core.",

    "text": "The guiding mission was to tell a story about Detroit, about this music, in a way that people who had no idea about it could come away with [an understanding of it] and want to know more about it. There are so many people that know facets of the history, [but] we couldn't make a film for them. We had to make a film for people who have no idea about Detroit and its techno origins. And that's generally the case: people here in the States have little to no idea about Detroit's role in electronic music.",
