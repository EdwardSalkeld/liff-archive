  "description": "In the shadow of the pandemic, a small town rallies to protect a beloved local book shop in its hour of need. A landmark in Lenox, Massachusetts, Hello, Bookstore is a magical, beatnik gem thanks to its owner, Matt Tannenbaum, whose passion for stories runs deep. Presiding at The Bookstore for over forty years, Matt is a true bard of the Berkshires and his shop is the kind of place to get lost in. This intimate portrait of The Bookstore and the family at its heart is like an immersive experience in a book shop: offering warmth, comfort, a journey through good times, hard times and the stories hidden on the shelves.",

    "text": "I've always loved fly on the wall documentaries. I've never really responded to the talking head style of movies. I don't want to hammer in things, I want there to be a sense of discovery while you're watching it. With the rhythm of [Hello, Bookstore], I took my cue from the store. I thought that, if we can get the atmosphere right, the contours of the story will figure out where they need to go. I wanted it to be cozy and relaxing, like you're in a bookstore.",
