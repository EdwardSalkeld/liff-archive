  "description": "Prosopagnosia is a colourful and personal exploration of face-blindness - a form of neurodiversity that renders someone incapable of recognizing faces. The film opens up an animated memory box of diaries, photographs and sketchbooks, combining themes of memory, masks and social interactions, to understand a life of seeing things differently."
