  "description": "A wicked comedic horror with arresting visuals introduces Philippa Dunne as Dorothy, who spends her days glued to her computer, sometimes literally with her lips, worshipping a pizza delivery boy she meets on-line. But as life treats her like a mouldy peach, she soon starts to feel like one."
