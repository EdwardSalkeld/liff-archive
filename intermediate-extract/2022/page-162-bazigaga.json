  "description": "1994, Rwanda. As the genocide rages on, a pastor and his young daughter take shelter in the hut of a feared shaman: Bazigaga. Hunted by the militias and trapped with the strange woman sorcerer, Karembe seeks a way out. Inspired by the true story of Zula Karuhimbi, a witch doctor who saved more than two hundred Tutsis from certain death."
