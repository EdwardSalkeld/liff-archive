  "description": "A larger-than-life character, Leeds saxophonist Matthew Coe AKA Xero Slingsby was an inspirational force in 1980s jazz with a fiery punk performance style. Shove It - the Xero Slingsby story celebrates his short but stellar life and career, lovingly chronicled by his bandmates, friends and family. From his start busking on the streets of West Yorkshire (for which he was arrested over 40 times) to his trio The Works' success on the live circuit across Europe, we witness his tirelessly passionate spirit first hand through high energy concert footage and interviews.",

    "text": "Matthew Coe's genius deserves to be celebrated. The film is the story of his music, his musicianship, his influences and those he has influenced. It's a story about creativity in the face of adversity, about living to make music, and making music to live. And it's also a very touching story about love and friendship and memory: one of the most striking things I found when making the film was just how much love for Matthew, for the man not just his music, is still out there – nearly 40 years after his death. It's testament to him and his energy that here we are all these years later still talking about him, still listening to his music and still finding it fresh and exciting.",
