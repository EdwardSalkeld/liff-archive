  "description": "Everyone who meets Freddie finds her startling yet alluring. She's 25 years old, appears outwardly Korean yet doesn't know the language, and is soon causing exotic chaos among an ad-hoc group of new friends. Freddie's return to Seoul is partly a half-hearted go at finding her biological parents, and partly an attempt to reinvent herself, something that she will try again and again. Return to Seoul made a big splash at Cannes 2022 and the film is much like the central performance by Park Ji-min: striking, distinctive, impossible to forget.",

    "text": "It's totally fictional. But it's strongly based on the life of a friend of mine, a French adoptee... After two days hanging out at [Busan Film Festival], she texted her Korean biological dad. …But in Korea they make the system very easy, as long as you have your file number. And I went along with her. So, there I was suddenly having Samgaetang [ginseng and chicken soup that Koreans associate with fertility] with the father and grandmother. I immediately felt that that's a scene that should be in a film. …What she imagined would be a one-time holiday trip, becomes something in which we follow the character over several years.",
