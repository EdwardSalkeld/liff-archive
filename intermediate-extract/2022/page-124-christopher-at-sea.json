  "description": "A queer melodrama set on a cargo ship, a transatlantic fantasy, an operatic labour of love that premiered this year in Venice. Each luminous frame is a piece of art, not to mention \"the most beautiful mohair jumper ever seen on the silver screen\", according to director Tom C J Brown."
