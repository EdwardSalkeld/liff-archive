  "description": "After graduating from an Orthodox seminary, tradition dictates Vitali should marry or become a monk. Instead, he moves in with his best friend, building a life where dreams and abstractions co-exist in delicate harmony. But change is on the horizon and Vitali's family wants to know: will he fulfil his destiny?"
