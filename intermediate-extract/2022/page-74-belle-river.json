  "description": "In Pierre-Part, Louisiana, residents prepare for the worst. Local authorities may be forced to open the floodgates of the Morganza Spillway in order to save the cities of New-Orleans and Bâton-Rouge from uncontrolled flooding. The consequences for Pierre-Part remain unspoken, leaving only faith and resilience in the face of uncertainty."
