  "description": "The directorial debut of actress and writer Karla Crome is a creepy and unnerving short. When a curator of a struggling art gallery is challenged by a journalist for putting on a controversial exhibition, she begins to question her ethical choices, and her sanity, as canvas no. 5 begins to exert it's own vengeful influence."
