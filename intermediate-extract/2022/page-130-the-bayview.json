  "description": "A once derelict hotel on the North East Coast of Scotland has become an unlikely refuge for the many international fishermen who pass through a small harbour town. They find the warmest of welcomes, and an inspiringly open, non-judgemental kindness, in another typically excellent short presented by The Scottish Documentary Institute."
