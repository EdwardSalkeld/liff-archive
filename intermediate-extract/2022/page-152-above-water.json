  "description": "Set against a backdrop of spellbinding desert landscapes, with a vibrant musical score, Above Water immerses us in the life of a village in Niger, one of the sub-Saharan countries hardest hit by global warming. Over the course of a year we see the effects of climate change and the slow transformation of a formerly nomadic community. Every day, 12-year-old Houlaye and her friends walk several kilometres to fetch water. As the village rallies together to obtain the construction of a well, there is promise of a new life. Followed by a panel discussion on Climate Change, supported by Global Leeds.",

    "text": "It was very important to be as close as possible to people and their experiences. I couldn't imagine this film being external, with a voice-over for example. I was lucky to have met gracious people who placed their trust in me... It was a way of highlighting how the issue of global warming affects the issue of migration. In the recent past, the rainy season lasted many months, whereas today it lasts three months. Ponds and wells were filled for most of the year, families stayed together and did not need to be separated for months. These were rich ethnic groups with very large herds. These people were not in need one or two generations ago.",
