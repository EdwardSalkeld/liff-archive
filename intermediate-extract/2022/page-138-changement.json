  "description": "Ballet has remained a highly traditional art form, with most of its movement and pieces revolving solely around heteronormative, cisgendered practices and labels. This documentary touches on historical elements of ballet while opening up the discussion around more inclusive and welcoming language, stories, and narratives."
