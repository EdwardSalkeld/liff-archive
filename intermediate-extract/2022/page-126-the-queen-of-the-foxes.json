  "description": "The Queen of the Foxes is sad. The saddest fox of all. To assuage her yearning, the pack of foxes skulk around the moonlit town, collecting discarded love letters the inhabitants never sent. But their plans have unexpected consequences, in an incredibly fluffy and cute fairytale of love and solidarity."
