  "description": "A surprising gem of a documentary straight out of Bradford profiles the Bradford Movie Makers, the oldest amateur film club around. Formed in 1932 back when the golden era of Hollywood inspired an equivalent in every Northern town, Bradford is the last determined survivor. With ageing members, dwindling funds and crumbling premises, they have to continually fight for their survival, but their resolution to do so despite some dubious film projects, is an inspiration. This warm, funny and tenderly moving film is the perfect antidote for an uncertain, digital age.",

    "text": "I have been interested in making a film about a club for years. So, I [was searching] for some time and stumbled over [Bradford Movie Club member] Joe on Facebook. At that time, Joe hadn't met Jeanette and was on his lonesome. He had written this beautiful lament about not having somebody in his life. I thought it was so emotionally honest for a Northern bloke as they usually keep everything held within. I then stumbled on a little film he had made with Phil on the rainy streets of Bradford, which appealed to my sensibilities. So, I thought, who are these guys?",
