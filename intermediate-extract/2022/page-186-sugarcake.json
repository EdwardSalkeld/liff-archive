  "description": "Damian is mourning the recent death of his only child. With a lack of willingness to carry on, he parks at the side of a desolate road, readying to shoot himself in the head. As he is about to pull the trigger, there is a knock on his window - a prostitute named Sugarcake appears mistaking the car as another potential client. She is forced with the unexpected ultimatum of whether or not to save this stranger's life."
