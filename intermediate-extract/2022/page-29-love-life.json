  "description": "Love Life is a moving and complex family drama about a young married couple, Taeko and Jiro, whose lives are shaken to the core by a tragic accident involving Taeko's son. The unexpected return of the boy's biological father, a troubled and vulnerable character, creates discord and confusion in the marriage. Director Koji Fukada approaches an emotionally devastating story with understated grace and intelligence, never lapsing into sentimentality. The cast are all superb, especially Fumino Kimura who shines as the gentle but strong willed Taeko. 'A beautifully wrought story of life after tragedy.' (The Hollywood Reporter)",

    "text": "When I make a film, I try to imagine how universal it can be. Therefore the main theme of Love Life is not the sadness of a couple who has lost a child, but the loneliness they feel due to their inability to share this pain. Sadness is unique to each person, while loneliness is inherent to mankind. I've been thinking about this film for fifteen years, with the singer Akiko Yano's voice going round in my head: 'No matter how far apart we are, I will always love you.' Like the isolation each half of the couple feels faced with their tragedy. This song that expresses both love and deep loneliness ended up so entwined with Love Life that I think it is actually the origin of the film.",
