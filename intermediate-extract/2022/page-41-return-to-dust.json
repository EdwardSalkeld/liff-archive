  "description": "A tender tale about the transformative nature of love, Return to Dust-the sixth film by acclaimed Chinese director Li Ruijun-expands into a poignant story of resilience against the odds. Humble, unassuming Ma and timid Cao are two middle aged outcasts forced into an arranged marriage by their families. Together they discover the small joys in the changing seasons and the strength to endure the hardship of poverty.\n\nIn the face of much adversity, an unexpected bond begins to blossom, as both Ma and Cao, uniting with Earth's cycles, create a precious haven for themselves.",
