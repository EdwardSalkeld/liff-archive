  "description": "When an asteroid hits the Earth, underwater volcanic eruptions risk submerging a riverside town and the inhabitants start to flee inland. The day before leaving, Nian says goodbye to a childhood friend but on her way she crosses paths with some of the town's residents. Gradually, her memories of the town start to become clearer and clearer in her mind."
