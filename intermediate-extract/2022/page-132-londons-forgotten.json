  "description": "In the misty streets of our capital, a wanderer drifts through an other-worldly narrative of the depressing and seemingly endless cycle of knife crime. The film is a poetic indictment of a system that allows the increasing and insidious effects of urban violence, on the forgotten victims, and those left to mourn."
