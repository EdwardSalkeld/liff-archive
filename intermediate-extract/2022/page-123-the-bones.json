  "description": "This incredible new multi-award winning film from The Wolf House (2018) directors Cristóbal León & Joaquín Cociña, is an account of the world's first stop-motion animated film. It documents a ritual performed by a girl who appears to use human corpses, resurrecting central figures in the construction of authoritarian and oligarchic Chile."
