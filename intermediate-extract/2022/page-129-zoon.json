  "description": "In an animated lesson of the indifference of nature, a species of frisky axolotl-creatures are unaware that they've become a tasty and transformative delicacy for a group of much larger forest dwellers. As their feast begins, these insatiable epicureans give no mind to the consequences their actions may result in."
