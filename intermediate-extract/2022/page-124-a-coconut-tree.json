  "description": "From seedling to shoot, from shoot to sturdy tree, animator Joshy Benedict parallels the lifespan of a coconut tree with that of the family who care for it. Suffused with light and music, there's a perfect simplicity to this touching film of how unexpected natural forces can affect our lives."
