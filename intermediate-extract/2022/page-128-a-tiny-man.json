  "description": "With a delicately pencilled animation style that recalls English animator Joanna Quinn, directors Aude David and Mikaël Gaudin tell a moral tale of nefarious schemes gone awry. As a husband faces the consequences of his actions, he perhaps begins to realise that maybe size does in fact matter."
