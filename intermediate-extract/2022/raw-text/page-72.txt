     ‘Matthew Coe’s genius deserves to be celebrated. The film is the story
     of his music, his musicianship, his influences and those he has influenced.
     It’s a story about creativity in the face of adversity, about living to make
     music, and making music to live. And it’s also a very touching story about
     love and friendship and memory: one of the most striking things I found
     when making the film was just how much love for Matthew, for the man
     not just his music, is still out there – nearly 40 years after his death. It’s
     testament to him and his energy that here we are all these years later still
     talking about him, still listening to his music and still finding it fresh and
     exciting.’ Director Robert Stanley Crampton
