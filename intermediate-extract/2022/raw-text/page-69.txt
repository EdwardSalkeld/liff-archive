‘I think an important point for us as the filmmakers is that we’ve always
had Roe v. Wade intact and don’t know what it is like not to have access
to abortion, so we want to show what is the reality like for people who
have to deal with this first hand. If Roe v. Wade is challenged and taken
away, this community has to deal with the consequences. That’s what
we want people to understand. It is not a black and white issue. Talking
about this is a personal choice, and everyone can identify with that.
What does it mean to forget about this debate and look at letting folks
make the decision they want to make?’ Co-Director Maya Cueva, from
an interview with Salon
