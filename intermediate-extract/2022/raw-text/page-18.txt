 classics of French cinema. Elegantly directed by Jacques Becker,           Raymond Hakim
 Casque d’Or is both a picturesque depiction of the Belle Epoque            Robert Hakim
 era at the turn of the twentieth century and a gritty tale of small-time   André Paulvé
 gangsters. Featuring a magnetic central performance by Simone              Leading Cast
 Signoret as Marie, who is caught between ex-con Manda, who                 Simone Signoret

 is trying to go straight, and the local crime boss Leca. Manda is          Claude Dauphin
 drawn into a web of deception and intrigue in a finely wrought             Cinematographer
 crime melodrama. Released by the Independent Cinema Office.                Robert Lefebvre

 ‘Signoret’s Marie occupies the moral and visual centre of Casque           Print Source
 d’or, Becker’s seventh feature. Like a black hole in deep space, she       ICO
 draws into her dense core a trio of male characters. She exudes an
 easy sexuality. But she can also reveal her vulnerability, depending
 on the demands of those around her and on her inbred but finite
 supply of toughness. Signoret has never shied from roles whose
 characters embrace startling pairs of opposites: neediness and
 independence, ferocity and meekness, innocence and dark
 experience… For all her swaggering, Marie finds herself clutching
 at a rapturous, fleeting happiness in Casque d’or.’ John Fidler,
