of an African female migrant worker. One Take Grace is a vibrant and
powerful display of a captivating woman and an incredible life story.

The collaboration between artist, Lindiwe Matshikiza (39), and actor
and community leader, Mothiba Grace Bapela (58) began with the
two women meeting as actors on a local film set in 2010. Lindiwe was
struck by Mme Bapela’s reflections on her life, and on the conflict of
needing steady – if poorly paid – domestic work. That first encounter
started a process of collaboration lasting over a decade, with Lindiwe
following Mme Bapela around- sometimes with the help of friends with
equipment, sometimes alone, with whatever was on hand – recording
her day-to-day life and past experiences. Through this deeply intimate
project, a portrait of both the woman and the country begins to
emerge, with certain questions being asked: How are the roles of our
dysfunctional society dished out? Who’s doing the casting? What kind
of set is this??
