 ‘The title stemmed from my time with an ace mattress. It was a good
 mattress and I paid some good money for it but it was so comfortable
 that whenever I woke up, my spine would hurt. Because this pain kept
 on repeating itself, I wanted to pinpoint the exact vertebra that was hurting
 and found out it was the fifth thoracic vertebra… Why was it always my
 fifth vertebra that hurt? Why not the third or the fourth? I think there was
 a creature in the bed, laughing at me, pricking at my spine every night.
 I threw the bed away but it disappeared overnight before the garbage-
 disposing people came over to pick it up. I wonder who took it and if
 their fifth thoracic vertebra hurt as well.’ Director Park Syeyoung, from
 an interview with Asian Movie Pulse
