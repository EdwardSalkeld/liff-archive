 ‘When you buy a world map from Japan, it’s Japan and the Pacific
 Ocean that are in the middle. So I saw Iceland on the far left-hand
 side. So it really is like the end of the world, especially for these kids. I
 wanted to emphasize the fact that they are actually going somewhere
 that they have no idea about, that being the end of the world. And I think
 that is important for these characters because they are both living in the
 countryside. That’s their entire world, but the world is so much bigger, and
 Iceland is the symbol of that… So they physically learn what the world is
 like and how different the world they see is. That’s what I wanted to say
 with this story.’ Director Atsuko Ishizuka, from an interview on Crunchyroll
