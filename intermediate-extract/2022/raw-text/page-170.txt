      aural experience, the film creates a lyrical evocation of a musical life.   Habanero Film Sales

      ‘Interviews are often conducted in extreme close-up via handheld camera,
      achieving a rare directness and intimacy as the engaging Muñoz Barroso
      befriends her helpful interlocutors. There is real energy and dynamism
      here. [...] The real wonder of the film, however, is the sound-design
      accomplished by Glenda L Martinez Cabrera and her team. As she
      notes early on in her extensive voice-over, Munoz Barroso experiences
      “progressive bilateral hearing loss”; Martinez Cabrera muffles and masks
      some sounds to convey the sensory perspective of a filmmaker whose
      work revolves around aural stimulations.’ Film Critic Neil Young
