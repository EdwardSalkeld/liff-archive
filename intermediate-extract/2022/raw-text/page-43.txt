‘Rodeo was born out of the meeting with the community I had been             Arthur Paux
following for years and my intimate desire to see a young woman rider        Print Source
one day lift her bike. Rodeo is for me an epic and sur-naturalist film. It   Curzon
goes beyond the naturalism of Au Loin Baltimore, in its relationship to
colour, narrative and direction. It pushes filmmaking to the very limit.
We shot with an Arri Alexa Mini camera, in a cinemascope format
(2:39), with anamorphic Master Prime lenses. Like the classic westerns.

carried away by the speed and adrenaline of bike-life. To show the
brutal side of it, the relationship to death, to the asphalt.’ Director
