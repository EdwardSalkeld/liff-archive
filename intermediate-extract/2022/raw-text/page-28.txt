 ‘For me the strength of cinema is to create an experience, a sensorial          Lights On
 experience, and that was my first goal with the film. I wanted to
 capture a feeling I was going through myself. I wanted to look closer
 at the process of grieving and give justice to it in a more realistic way.
 Moreover, there is a very particular atmosphere in this region of
 Mississippi we were traveling to at that time that I liked and wanted
 to show as well. I felt that a lot of things, the fantasies and the illusions
 about an unrealistic idea of success, were falling apart. I felt that there
 is a real feeling of grief among the American people.’ Director Bianca
 Lucas, from an interview with Cineuropa
