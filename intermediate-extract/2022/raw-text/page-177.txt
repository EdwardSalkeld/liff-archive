                      LIFF 2022 Spotlights —
                      One Love from Jamaica
                      On 3 April 1962 Jamaica declared ‘Out of Many,
                      One People’ as the nation’s motto, just four months
                      before independence from Britain was ushered in
                      on 6 August. Sixty years on it is more relevant for the
                      whole world today than ever, one which has inspired
                      the Jamaica Society Leeds’ Out of Many Festival. We
                      are delighted to be presenting the film programme for
                      Out of Many Festival as part of LIFF 2022.
                      The cultural impact, beauty and depth of Jamaican
                      film shine through in classics like Babylon, Rockers,
                      and The Harder They Come, presented in its 50th
                      anniversary year and introduced by Justine Henzell.
                      The vibrant sounds of Jamaica reverberate through
                      the music documentaries Studio 17: The Lost Reggae
                      Tapes, The Story of Lovers Rock, and Inna de Yard:
                      The Soul of Jamaica. Some of the features will also
                      screen with impressive short films handpicked by
                      JAFTA, the Jamaica Film & TV Association.
