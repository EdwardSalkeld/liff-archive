     citizens step forward to save an ancient forest from one of Europe’s             Editor
     largest coal mines. They form an unlikely alliance with a frustrated             Ariadna Fatjó-Vilas
     community in rural England who are forced into action to protect their           Print Source
     homes from a new opencast coal mine. Finite is an insider’s view of the          Espresso Media
     world of direct action; a raw, authentic and emotional insight into the
     David and Goliath battle between frontline communities, activists and
     fossil fuel corporations.

     ‘Finite tackles an issue which impacts us all, the climate crisis and our
     addiction to fossil fuels which is pushing us to disaster. But crucially,
     despite the ubiquity of this issue, [the film] is an insight into a world that
     few of us are truly engaged with - the frontline battle between ordinary
     people and fossil fuel companies. Importantly, the film gives us hope for
     how the tide can be turned against climate breakdown; not with naive
     optimism, but by laying bare what is possible with collective action,
     because hope is action. If you’re anxious about the climate crisis -
     (let’s face it, who isn’t?) - then you need to watch this film.’ Director
     Rich Felgate, from an interview with We Are Moving Stories
