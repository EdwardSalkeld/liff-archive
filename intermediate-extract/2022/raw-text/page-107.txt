                                                                    Leeds Short Film Awards
           We love short films at LIFF! We show more shorts
           than features – with 110 from 50 countries this year.
           They are a vital opportunity for new filmmakers to
           reach audiences and the film industry.
           A qualifying festival for short films for the Academy
           Awards, BAFTAs, and British Independent Film
           Awards, LIFF presents seven competitions, each
           judged by different juries.
           The Leeds International Short Film Competition
           is our largest selection, with four programmes of
           outstanding new shorts from across the world. The
           British Short Film Competition celebrates homegrown
           filmmaking and the Yorkshire Short Film Competition
           champions shorts from new creative talent in the
           region. The World Animation Competition brings
           together brilliant British and International animated
           gems in two bumper programmes.
           We also present short film competitions dedicated
           to dance films and music videos and to the work
           of queer filmmakers in two programmes curated
           for LIFF by Leeds Queer Film Festival.
           All the competitions except for Music Videos are
           available on our streaming platform Leeds Film
           Player during LIFF 2022 – see the schedule in this
           guide to find out from when they can be viewed.
