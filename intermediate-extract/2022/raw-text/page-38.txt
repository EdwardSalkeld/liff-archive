 Oleksandr Yatsentyuk as the eponymous hero. Part drama, part                  Sobchuk

 ‘I believe that during the last 30 years of Ukrainian independence,           Nikita Kuzmenko
 we acquired the aspirations of previous generations: we want to               Editor
 separate ourselves from imperial Soviet influence… Pamfir is a father         Nikodem Chabior
 who wishes the best to his sibling and does everything possible               Print Source
 and impossible to achieve that. He actually sacrifices himself and            Indie Sales
 his beliefs to make his son live a better life. The more we reflect on
 who we are and why we are on this path of war, the more we will
 realize that the basics of this fight for freedom were laid not over the
 last 10 or 30 years, but over centuries. It seems to me that Pamfir is a
 typical Ukrainian who fights for his future having had a difficult past.’
