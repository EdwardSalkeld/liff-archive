Vitality                            Joie de vivre is the perfect expression for this
                                    marvellously tactile story. It’s the second in our
Print Source mikhal.bak@gmail.com   programme to feature a fairground, which is
                                    emblematic of the freedom and fun sought by
                                    the young woman who is attracted to emerge
                                    from her safe, but cramped environment, by
                                    music and light.

                                    transformative delicacy for a group of much
                                    larger forest dwellers. As their feast begins,
