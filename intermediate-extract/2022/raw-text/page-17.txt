‘During my scriptwriting and research in Korea, I was able to hear the          Picturehouse
stories of the children who had been left in a ‘baby box’. Watching the
children desperately questioning themselves, “Was it really a good thing
for me to be born?”, I was filled with the urge to make a film that could
answer that question. …With this topic, I did not want to come to an
ending where the abandoned children regret being born, or the mother
regretting having the child. I wanted the film to be able to directly deliver
the message, “It was good to be born.” In that sense, Broker is a film
about ‘life’.’ Director Hirokazu Kore-eda
