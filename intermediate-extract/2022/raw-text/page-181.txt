‘[As an] old fan of this music, it was with enthusiasm that I recently
traveled to Jamaica to meet some of my idols of the time, in great
shape and still active. The excitement of approaching these musicians,
of listening to their story of their very beginnings, when the scene was
in its infancy, how they survived the lean years that followed, and
then their comeback, in recent years, was very inspiring. …This very
personal project filled me with enthusiasm and passion. It took me
back to the teenager I once was – a kid who saved his pocket money
to go find the latest Jamaican sounds on [London’s] All Saints Road.’
Director Peter Webber
