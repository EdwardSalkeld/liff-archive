 ‘I myself have mixed backgrounds. I am always wondering, “Where
 do I belong? Where is my home?”. Especially when I was a teenager,
 I hesitated to call the place where I live now ‘my country’ and felt out
 of place. The Kurds are the largest ethnic group without its own country.
 They have a history of fighting for their own place in the world. What
 exactly “my country” means? I feel that the existence of these people
 strongly questions this. Originally, we thought of having Kurds who live
 in Japan appear as the main characters. However, we could not find a
 way to have them appear in a film without worrying about their refugee
 status. In the process of making this film, we learned with devastation
 that we live in a country where we could not ask people to perform
 freely.’ Director Emma Kawawada
