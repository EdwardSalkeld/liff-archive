      Gary Tarn, telling the remarkable story of French artist Hugues de                      John Battsek
      Montalembert, who was blinded during a violent assault in New York                      Alfonso Cuarón
      in 1978. De Montalembert narrates, explaining the ways he found                         Nick Fraser
      to cope with a life-changing trauma, working this experience into his                   Leading Cast
      artistic practice and developing a unique philosophy on life. Tarn uses                 Hugues de Montalembert

      extraordinary, expressionistic means to visualise the world from the blind              Gary Tarn
      artist’s perspective. The result is a life affirming testimony and a fascinating        Editor
      meditation on the nature of perception.                                                 Gary Tarn

      ‘I had played [Hugues de Montalembert] some music incorporating
      speech that I had put together, and he liked that; I think that gave him
      sufficient faith that I had at least some musical ability. [...] I think his attitude
      was that the book was his work, and the film was mine, and so it was up
      to me, in a sense, to make it work. After we had recorded the interviews,
      however, I did feel quite a weight of responsibility to make something of
      value – I knew he had given me something very special in them, and I
      wanted to rise to the challenge.’ Director Gary Tarn
