     ‘We met Vera Gemma in 2015 while we were shooting our film Mister             Terratreme Films
     Universo; she was working on a documentary about circus artists, in
     honor of her late father Giuliano Gemma, a very popular actor in Italy.
     When she was introduced to us, I found her very strange, and we only
     exchanged a few words. Two weeks later we sat next to her at a dinner,
     and we had a wonderful conversation, because she has a very critical
     and ruthlessly honest way of calling a spade a spade. That was a good
     lesson, confirming yet again that it’s always necessary to look beyond
     the surface. I succumbed to her fascination very quickly, visited her quite
     often in Rome, read her autobiography and watched her father’s films.
     One day I told her I’d like to write a script about her.’ Co-director
     Tizza Covi
