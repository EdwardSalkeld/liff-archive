     ‘I’ve always loved fly on the wall documentaries. I’ve never really
     responded to the talking head style of movies. I don’t want to hammer
     in things, I want there to be a sense of discovery while you’re watching
     it. With the rhythm of [Hello, Bookstore], I took my cue from the store.
      I thought that, if we can get the atmosphere right, the contours of the
     story will figure out where they need to go. I wanted it to be cozy
     and relaxing, like you’re in a bookstore.’ Director Adam Zax, from
     an interview with The Guardian
