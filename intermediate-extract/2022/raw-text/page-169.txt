framing of disability as spectacle.

‘People are usually seeing me but not hearing me, so I wanted to do
 the opposite. I really just wanted to show how a disabled person
does—or does not—fit into society, and how disabled people need to
adapt to be “palatable” to society. I wanted to present an approximate
version of my vision, without giving viewers the “satisfaction” of looking
at me. [...] This isn’t an autobiography. This is a film about me in a
specific place and time—or, I should say, a version of me that doesn’t
exist in real life. It’s a specific version that you see on-screen.’ Director
Reid Davenport
