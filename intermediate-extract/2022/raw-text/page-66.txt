     ‘There is an aesthetic of the ugly. In all that is ugly lies beauty. The film
     plays with this. The places we see are fascinating. But we can’t stop to
     look at just the surface. We have to go further. Everything we produce
     or use ends up to be trash at some point. Once we throw it away, it’s not
     gone. The process starts just then. A big industry is behind it and a huge
     amount of people are concerned by it. In Europe we have a relatively
     good way to cope with trash by burning it and by gaining energy out
     of it. But still it doesn’t disappear completely either.’ Director Nikolaus
     Geyrhalter, from an interview with Cineuropa
