‘We were not interested in disorienting the viewer but in trying to         Les Films du Losange
install you in some places and reveal later where you were. I don’t
know if you knew you were in an urethra before the camera pulls you
out of it. So, sometimes we play with this to show you an interior space
or territory, where you can get your bearings but don’t know exactly
what it is. We allow you to see things you’re not usually used to see,
then suddenly the disorientation doesn’t come from being inside, it
comes from when you get out. You know where you were—in a head,
a urethra, an abdominal cavity.’ Co-Director Véréna Paravel, from
an interview with Filmmaker magazine.
