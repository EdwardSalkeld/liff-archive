‘It is a totally unconventional horror movie, which deals with the most toxic   Film Factory
relationship possible between a mother and her son, drawing a parallel
between a dictator and the people, more specifically the dictatorship in
North Korea. We have all been in a toxic relationship, it doesn’t matter

are deeply complicated; I am sure that anyone reading this is, or has
been in a relationship like this, but… how can you get out of it? And
if you manage to get out, how, and for how long will you stay out?’
