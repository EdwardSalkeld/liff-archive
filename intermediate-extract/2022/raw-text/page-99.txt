‘It’s been a long process to get to Viking. The first spark of the movie           Print Source
was an exhibit I saw in New York by photographer Vincent Laforet. He               Sphere Films
did these really large format pictures of astronauts lost in the desert. I think
the pictures were taken in the Utah desert. These pictures struck me. I kept
thinking about them for several years. I wanted to do a sci-fi movie after
my last film, Tu dors, Nicole. These images kept coming back. Around
2014 or 2015, I heard about the Mars One project, where anyone could
apply for a one-way trip to Mars. I was wondering who would apply for
that kind of thing. At first, I wanted to tell the story of someone applying
for this project. Then, the script became something else.’ Director Stéphane
Lafleur, from an interview with Seventh Row
