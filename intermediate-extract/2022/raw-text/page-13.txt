‘With Baby Pyramid, I want to take the audience on a nerve-wracking           Editor
journey into a fascinating and exotic environment, just as I want to raise    Esben Grundsøe
a number of complex ethical dilemmas. Baby Pyramid is a story about           Print Source
the basic needs of humans, which Maslow’s pyramid of needs defines,           Nordisk Film Distribution
and this is where the inspiration for the title comes from. It is about the
longing to reproduce and about the powerlessness that arises from not
knowing some of the most animalistic and basic - creating new life…

about childlessness, which can hopefully provide an insight into some
of the unreasonably difficult and taboo emotions one goes through
as an involuntarily childless person.’ Director Cecilie McNair
