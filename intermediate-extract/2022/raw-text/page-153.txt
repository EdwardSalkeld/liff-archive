‘The film was born from a real encounter, painful yet inspiring, that           Print Source
forever left an indelible mark on me. I knew a young woman who                  Films Boutique
inspired me for the character of Samia. She landed in Tangier, fleeing
her family after becoming pregnant then being left by the man who
had promised to marry her…My parents took her in when she showed
up on their doorstep, although they didn’t even know her…I felt an
urgency to write and tell this story upon becoming a mother myself.
Her story came together with my own wounds, my experience with
loss, the distress one can feel, the denial, the unresolved grief. Yet, there
also was my joy to be a mother. This is how Adam began to take shape.’
