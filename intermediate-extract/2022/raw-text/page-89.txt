contradictions, just like the complex conflict the protagonist undergoes
throughout the film… Huesera explore the idea that what appears to
be the ideal of happiness, that which is so familiar, pastel-coloured,
luminous, and musically harmonious, can become horrific for certain
people. In contrast what appears to be subterranean, discrepant, noisy,

in Valeria’s life causes her perception of familiarity to be progressively
altered, confronting her with atmospheres that go through the
uncomfortable and reach the sinister.’ Director Michelle Garza Cervera
