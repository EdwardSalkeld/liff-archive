     Belle River                                In Pierre-Part, Louisiana, residents prepare for the
                                                worst. Local authorities may be forced to open the
     Print Source projets@spira.quebec          floodgates of the Morganza Spillway in order to
                                                save the cities of New-Orleans and Bâton-Rouge
                                                from uncontrolled flooding. The consequences for
                                                Pierre-Part remain unspoken, leaving only faith
                                                and resilience in the face of uncertainty.
