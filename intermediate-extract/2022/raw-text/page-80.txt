     ‘A heartfelt and hilarious comedy-drama about making it to the top
     without compromising one’s vision, Anime Supremacy! is the second
     feature film from director Kohei Yoshino, who worked in the CG
     department of Makoto Shinkai’s Your Name. That experience likely
     helped him match original novelist Mizuki Tsujimura’s detailed and
     convincing examination of just how anime gets made - the pressures
     from the producers, the deadlines and difficulties, the myriad technical
     tasks that each contribute to the success or failure of the final product.
     There’s a similar verisimilitude in the performances of the cast, led by
     Riho Yoshioka of Louder!: Can’t Here What You’re Singin’, Wimp, and
     Tomoya Nakamura, co-star of the forthcoming Kamen Rider Black Sun
     TV series.’ Fantasia Festival
