‘We shot by following the seasonal changes, the life cycle of the crops    Print Source
and even the migratory bird season. We spent almost six months in          Modern Films
pre-production to map out a detailed shooting plan and schedule. I
used to tend to my family’s farm when I was young. With the help of the
main actor Wu Renlin, who is my uncle, his son who plays the second
nephew, my brother and my father, we were all involved in building the
farmhouse and growing the crops until harvest time. We worked like
peasants the whole time and dedicated our lives to the land, just like
them.’ Director Li Ruijun, from an interview with Screen Daily
