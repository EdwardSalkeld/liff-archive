     The latest from the multiple Palme d’Or winning Belgian duo the Dardenne             Luc Dardenne

     Brothers is a tender portrait of two young West African migrants as they             Jean-Pierre Dardenne
     try to make it in the European immigration system. Inseparable friends Tori          Luc Dardenne
     and Lokita are posing as siblings to try and secure permission for the older         Producer
     Lokita to stay on as a refugee. The authorities make it increasingly difficult       Peter Bouckaert
     for them to stay together as they struggle to make it. Never sentimental but         Jean-Pierre Dardenne
                                                                                          Luc Dardenne
     heartbreakingly moving, Tori and Lokita is the finest Dardennes film for             Leading Cast
     some time.                                                                           Pablo Schils

     ‘Our film tells the story of a friendship, a beautiful and intense friendship, not   Alban Ukaj
                                                                                          Cinematographer
     a betrayed friendship but an unfailing friendship. It wasn’t until we imagined       Benoît Dervaux
     such a friendship as the core of our film that we felt that our two main             Editor
     characters, Lokita and Tori, were coming to life as unique human beings, that        Marie-Hélène Dozo
     they were moving beyond the media-defined image of those young migrants              Print Source
     known as “unaccompanied foreign minors”, that they were becoming more                Picturehouse
     than the mere illustration of a case, a situation, a theme or a subject. Not that
     their situation is unimportant. Far from it. On the contrary, their situation as
     exiled, solitary, exploited and humiliated adolescents has acquired a new
     dimension thanks to their friendship, which gained strength through their
     response to it and, unwittingly, our film has also become a denunciation of
     the violent and unjust situation experienced by these young people in exile
     in our country, in Europe.’ Directors Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne
