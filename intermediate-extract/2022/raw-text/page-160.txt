      Premiering in the Directors’ Fortnight section of this year’s Cannes,    Leading Cast

      ‘From the outset, the need to work with non-professional actors and      Frida Marzouk
      actresses became apparent in this environment. I wanted to work          Editor
      with people from this region, who speak the particular dialect of this   Hugues Dardart
      originally Berber Village…. I never gave them written dialogue. They     Print Source
      were simply given the trajectories of their characters and the various   Luxbox
      relationships they had with each other throughout the day, as well as
      what was intended for each scene and how this was structured. Then
      they improvised with all this and I re-wrote accordingly. They used
      their own words, their own way of talking, speaking with the accent
      that I know so well, because this is how my father speaks.’ Director
