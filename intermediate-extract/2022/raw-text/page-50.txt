         lawyer in İstanbul, who begins to hear the sound of a cat meowing in         Tanay Abbasoglu

         awake at night, Zuhal knocks on the doors of her neighbours whom             Leading Cast
         she previously avoided. As the situation becomes more absurd, Zuhal’s        Nihal Yalcin
                                                                                      Fatih Al

         ‘Once at a friends’ gathering I met a woman who told me of a constant        Selda Taskin
         meowing she kept hearing in her at. While searching for the cat she          Print Source
         discovered that no one else hears it. Moreover, people started doubting      Film Republic
         her mental health. Later she found a cat stuck in one of the plumbing
         pipes. I was also intrigued: Would I keep searching or would I just
         ignore the meow in fear of being labelled as mad?... Zuhal’s 36-hour
         pursuit is depicted closely, in a tender and humorous narrative. Talkative
         moments are as important as silences. Throughout the pursuit she faces
         various encounters, each a performance. The lm’s tone is based on the
         absurdity that comes of such human conversations in modern settings.’
