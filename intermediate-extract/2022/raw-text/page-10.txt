 This beautiful debut feature is set on an elegiac 1990s summer holiday          Amy Jackson
 at a Turkish package resort. We see events through the eyes of pre-teen         Leading Cast
 Sophie (newcomer Frankie Corio), who is there with her soulful, doleful         Paul Mescal
 dad Calum (Paul Mescal). They share an easy bond, yet Calum may                 Frankie Corio
 not be as ‘OK’ as he tries to appear. Aftersun expresses a complex              Celia Rowlson-Hall

 dad would often be mistaken for my brother. It always seemed a fun
 relationship to explore on film and when I was flipping through old
 holiday albums toward the end of film school, the idea began to take

 of the trip, but their relationship itself isn’t a huge source of conflict. I

 life, but being a parent isn’t one of them.’ Director Charlotte Wells, from
