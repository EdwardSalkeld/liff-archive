      ‘This film is structured as a first-person account of Kathryn’s final
      stage before death. It is, in its totality, her plea for the wider world to
      understand what she went through, why she persisted, and finally why
      she gave up. So, rather than turning and looking at Kathryn, or asking
      others to sit down and tell us about her, we aim to bring the viewer as
      close as possible to actually being Kathryn and experiencing what she
      experienced. Through Kathryn’s own narration, we enter the inner world
      of a severely disabled woman and mother facing her own mortality.’
