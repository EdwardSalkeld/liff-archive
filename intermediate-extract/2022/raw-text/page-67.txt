‘Chile is a difficult and complicated country. What we mean by an
imaginary country is that the future is not written, and these protestors
are working towards a society that they would like and hope to see. It’s
the future country that’s imaginary until it comes to pass. We wanted to
concentrate on the voices of women because that is the big difference
between the 1970s and today: the role of women in public life. Today,
women are a central part of public life and their voice is important, and
it was particularly essential in this movement.’ Director Patricio Guzmán,
from an interview with Cineuropa
