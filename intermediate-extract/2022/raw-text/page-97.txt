ingeniously toying with narrative structure. The atmosphere of the film,       Predrag ‘Miki’ Manojlovic
set almost entirely in a single location, is unsettling in a way reminiscent   Ivana Roscic

and mood of The Uncle: ‘Family celebrations are always stressful.              Ecelectica
From preparing the food for days, to getting the tree that never seems
to be right, to decorating it in a different way every year, only for it to
turn up always the same freaky kitsch… Christmas is actually a holiday
for which everybody, from the media and marketing, to the Church
and the tradition, forces us to do something in order to feel better.
Instead, everybody ends up fat, angry, frustrated and in conflict with
the others, so everybody cannot wait for the whole thing to be over.
Christmas actually represents the greatest subliminal attack to the
subconsciousness where form takes over substance.’ Directors Andrija
Mardešić and David Kapac, from an interview with Cineuropa
