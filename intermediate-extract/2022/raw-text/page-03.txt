     LIFF X Film Festivals
                                                                                 Introduction
     We love film festivals at LIFF, naturally, and the teams of thousands
     across the world like us are passionate about celebrating and
     promoting film culture and dedicated to sharing the work of diverse
     filmmakers with audiences. This year we are thrilled to collaborate
     with the team of a film festival in Africa, Films Femmes Afrique in
     Dakar, who do amazing work supporting films by and about
     African women and taking them to communities across Senegal.
     Our collaboration with Films Femmes Afrique is one of three spotlight
     programmes at LIFF 2022. We have partnered with the Imagining
     Technologies for Disability Futures team at the University of Leeds
     on a programme about disability and new technology, and with
     Jamaica Society Leeds on a celebration of Jamaican culture on film.
     LIFF is also part of the UK/Ukraine Season of Culture, presented by
     the British Council and Ukrainian Institute.
     Our regular programme sections – Official Selection, Cinema Versa,
     Fanomenon, and Leeds Short Film Awards – return for LIFF 2022.
     As part of Official Selection this year, we are launching the New
     Directors Competition to expand our support for new filmmakers
     and for films without distribution yet, with UK Premieres of eight
     features by first or second-time directors, six of whom are women.
     We hope you are inspired by your LIFF 2022 experience to discover
     more film festivals!
