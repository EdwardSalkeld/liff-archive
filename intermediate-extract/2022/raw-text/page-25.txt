‘A couple of years ago my parents came back from a wedding, very              Print Source
excited. They told me they met a couple their age and they want me to         Charades
find them on Facebook. I found it extremely sweet and a little bit
embarrassing, but I helped them. When I opened the couple’s Facebook
page, I was shocked by the way this couple looked. They were my
parent’s age but had colourful glasses and velvet jackets. They were the
most flamboyant 60-year-old people I’ve ever seen. It made me laugh,
but when I looked into my parents’ admiring faces, I realized I know that
excitement, it reminded me of high school, and how I admired the new
cool kid in school, how I wanted to be close to him. I could suddenly see
the teenagers that still exist in them. That’s when I knew who Meir, Tova
and Itsik were.’ – Director Moshe Rosenthal
