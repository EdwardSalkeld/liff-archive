      Dwoskin, Face of Our Fear was originally broadcast in 1992 as part        Lux
      of Channel 4’s ‘Disabling World’ season. Rich in archival material
      and expansive in its scope, the film examines the historical narratives
      and attitudes that have perpetuated through images of disability,
      with sources ranging from Classical antiquity, and the Middle Ages,
      to 19th century literature and Hollywood cinema. This screening will
      be followed by a panel discussion.

      ‘Face Of Our Fear is a richly conceived essay about the evolving
      image of disability. Dwoskin, a highly accomplished experimental
      filmmaker, begins with the declaration that the historically distorted
      images of people with disabilities constitute a “negation of selfhood”.
      He then traces this concerted effort through two thousand years of
      Western culture, beginning with the Greek notion of the idealised body
      and its opposite, the fabulous races. Using contemporary films clips,
      literary quotations, performance, and pictorial records, Face Of Our
      Fear looks at the Court’s infatuation with “monsters” during the Middle
      Ages, the “charity cripples” of the Enlightenment, the freakshows
      of the nineteenth century, each a resort to oppressive stigmatisation.’
