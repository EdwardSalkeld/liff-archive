willed Taeko. ‘A beautifully wrought story of life after tragedy.’ (The      MK2
Hollywood Reporter)

‘When I make a film, I try to imagine how universal it can be. Therefore
the main theme of Love Life is not the sadness of a couple who has lost
a child, but the loneliness they feel due to their inability to share this
pain. Sadness is unique to each person, while loneliness is inherent to
mankind. I’ve been thinking about this film for fifteen years, with the
singer Akiko Yano’s voice going round in my head: “No matter how far
apart we are, I will always love you.” Like the isolation each half of the
couple feels faced with their tragedy. This song that expresses both love
and deep loneliness ended up so entwined with Love Life that I think it
is actually the origin of the film.’ Director Kôji Fukada
