‘The film is pure fantasy – it touches on the political, it touches on the         Albert Serra
contemporary, and it touches on the human and human relations, but in the          Artur Tort
end, I like the idea that it’s exotic, artificial and unbelievable. All of these   Print Source
relations between these two people – De Roller and Shannah – are almost            New Wave
grotesque… I only made one trip, and I was supposed to shoot immediately,
and then COVID-19 happened. I prefer the friction of going there and not
knowing anything, and being with the whole crew. The friction, the clashes,
the shock. This creates innocence and spontaneity. There are lots of things
that aren’t under control – it’s the total nightmare of industry people. They
want to keep everything under control because it’s a huge industry and
there’s time pressure. But with this, you only get one thing or the other –
you are economically comfortable, but you are artistically f***ed.’
Director Albert Serra, from an interview for Cineuropa
