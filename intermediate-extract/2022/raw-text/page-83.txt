‘My main concern with the film was to explore the daily life of the              Editor
superhero who is growing up or needs to grow up. The meaning of                  Panayu Kunvanlee
the superhero to me is an ordinary person who is very good at doing              Print Source
something. So I have to find the occupation of the main character, what          GDH
is the superpower in their life. I started with an athlete, someone who’s
running fastest. I explored more and more until I found sports stacking.
I watched video clips of the sport stackers and they were very fast: they
finished stacking within four seconds! And to me it’s kind of like a special
ability, like, How can you do that? It’s so amazing. I thought, It’s the right
thing for the film. So I chose cup stacking or sports stacking.’ Director
