     at our neighbor’s place when I was 15 and read Empress Elisabeth’s            Print Source
     biography pretty much in parallel. As a teenager, I had all kinds of          Picturehouse
     questions when I finished the book. Why did Empress Elisabeth have fitness
     equipment built for her? Why did she refuse to be painted after she was
     40? I told Marie [Kreutzer, director] all that and she didn’t say a word at
     first. But then something amazing happened …I opened my mailbox and
     there was an envelope with the finished script. Marie had just added a
     note saying something like: “I went back to the archives. You were right”.
     That was so classy. ‘ Actress Vicky Krieps
