     Hong Sang-soo is a charming, playful, and poignant cinematic treat,               Leading Cast
     receiving its UK Premiere at LIFF 2022. Junhee is a novelist who has              Lee Hye-yeong
     grown disenchanted with her own writing. On a trip to see an old                  Kim Min-hee
     friend, she runs into a film director who was set to adapt one of her             Seo Younghwa
     novels before the project fell through. One chance encounter leads to             Cinematographer
                                                                                       Hong Sang-soo

     ‘I had a piece that was shot in a most natural setting. There was no
     script, no idea to express anything, I wanted to compare this kind of
     footage with the people acting based on a script I gave. I don’t think
     there is absolute naturalness. Even being alone in our own room, we
     don’t know if we can call it natural. I don’t think I’m seeking to be really
     natural. I just happen to be that kind of director. I like to see small details
     working on significant elements, so I’m kind of relatively more natural.
     Many small details happen in a scene. I scan and look through them,
     and when I feel OK, I let them exist in the scene.’ Director Hong
     Sang-Soo
