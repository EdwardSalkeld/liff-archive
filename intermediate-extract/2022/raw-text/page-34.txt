     ‘One day I heard about the death of a young girl. She was a stranger
     to me, but why did my heart hurt so badly to hear of it? Why did I feel
     so sorry for that child? Three years have passed, but her story has
     stayed with me like a lump in my throat. I just had to find out more about
     her. About how it happened. And so I got to know about Sohee. I found
     Detective Oh Yoo-jin, who had met Sohee. A child who succumbed to
     death all alone, and an adult who knew better than anyone the horror
     of being all alone. Their paths crossed, though at different points in time.
     The child is gone and no more, but from the bottom of my heart I wish
     that inside this film she shall remain alive, and be a name that many
     remember for a long time.’ Director July Jung
