     interweaving ten short films by ten young anonymous Burmese filmmakers.         Corinne van Egeraat
     The filmmakers combine mobile phone shot footage of protests and civil          Editor
     disobedience with more poetic reflections of life for ordinary people           Petr Lom
     under the brutal military junta. After a military coup, thousands of peaceful   Print Source
     protesters are imprisoned and murdered and a popular armed revolt has           ICA
     grown in resistance. The filmmakers are witnesses and participants in an
     urgent dispatch of citizen journalism as Myanmar is a low priority in the
     international headlines around the world.

     ‘This regime, I just don’t think they have any idea. They are very impulsive,
     power-hungry and they are basically just clueless how to respond to
     the crisis. They were very, very short-sighted when they staged the coup
     [in Myanmar]. [For us, filming] is about being discreet, being alert and
     just generally being smart about it....Of course, we have to make the
     [participants] anonymous. How are we going to cleverly hide their faces
     in a very aesthetic and artful way without resorting to cheap measures
     like having them wear a mask…we enjoy the challenge, and each piece
     is made in complete creative freedom, as far as safety allows us!’ An
     anonymous member of the Myanmar Film Collective, from an interview
     with Business Doc Europe
