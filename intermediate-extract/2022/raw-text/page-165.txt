                                                                              Disability Futures
                   LIFF 2022 Spotlights — Disability Futures
                   Disability Futures is a season of films exploring
                   innovative representations of disability on screen.
                   We celebrate films by disabled filmmakers who
                   make creative use of film technology to share their
                   perspectives, like Reid Davenport’s extraordinary
                   debut I Didn’t See You There.
                   We also focus on films involving the creative
                   collaboration of disabled participants like Kathryn
                   Arjomand in her son Noah’s deeply moving Eat Your
                   Catfish. Disabled actor Petri Poikolainen shines in
                   Finnish thriller The Blind Man Who Did Not Want to
                   See Titanic, and hearing-impaired filmmaker Daniela
                   Muñoz Barroso uses innovative cinematography and
                   sound design in Mafifa.
                   An exciting VR experience, archive films and talks
                   challenge stereotypical representations of disability,
                   anticipate future developments, and discuss new
                   technologies.
                   Disability Futures is presented by LIFF 2022 and the
                   University of Leeds and funded by the Wellcome Trust.
                   Disability Futures is also presented in partnership with
                   injury and litigation specialist law firm Stewarts.
