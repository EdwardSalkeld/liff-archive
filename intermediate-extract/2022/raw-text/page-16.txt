     ‘Acting is a combination of discipline and freedom. For instance, the girl
     who plays the friend of the heroine in Brief Encounters was a tremendous
     discovery for me. In The Long Farewell she plays the pregnant daughter
     of a post office employee. She’s enormously talented – not because of her
     education, it’s innate. All her lines in Brief Encounters are scripted and she
     performs them exactly right. She learned the text by heart but performed
     it as though she had invented it on the spot. That’s professionalism. Sudden
     bright ideas that cannot be repeated mark the amateur. You should be
     able to say to the actor: repeat this but do it a little more softly and add this
     movement. She was able to repeat a piece with the same natural quality
     as the first time, while simultaneously making small alterations.’ Director
     Kira Muratova from an interview by Mart Dominicus and Mark-Paul
     Meyer, 1988 Translated by Veva Leye
