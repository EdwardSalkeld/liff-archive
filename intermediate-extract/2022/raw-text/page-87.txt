‘My touchstone for this tonally – because obviously there’s Elm Street and
Freddy Krueger, people are automatically going to think of anyone working
in dreams is like standing on the shoulders of Freddy Krueger to some
degree, and I do love that - but Jacob’s Ladder was the film that I was really
reaching for and studying, because it’s one of the first films to really scare me.
And it does involve dreams and, you know, surreal layers of consciousness
and transitions that you aren’t expecting, but also, it’s just more human. The
camera is more relaxed and handheld like it is in the Harbinger, and it feels
more down and dirty, and less just stylized and surreal and there to mess with
you for the sake of it. I tried to mess with people with intention, or purpose.’
