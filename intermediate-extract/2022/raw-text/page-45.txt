aged 14 and 15. In the case of these characters, they have been                 Editor
‘preserved’ in their child-like state, with few memories of their previous      António Gonçalves
 life or their mothers. When describing this particular type of dictatorship    Print source

keep other things in the past. But we should question the present instead,
because some of them are still happening.’ Director Carlos Conceição,
from an interview with Cineuropa
