 reality, she’s like a very earthy person. And Yotam’s colours are the warm
 colours, the red and the orange and the yellow. I can imagine that he
 painted the apartment, that’s how he’s dressed, that’s why he’s cooking
 in this kitchen surrounded by yellow, and for him it’s about vivid, about
 life and about sunlight. This was like a clear vision for me, I knew wanted
 it to be very obvious in the film – in the props, in the clothes, in the colour
 palette of the shooting.’ Director Ofir Raul Graizer
