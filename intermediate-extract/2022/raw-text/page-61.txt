Sable Island, guided by naturalist and environmentalist Zoe Lucas who       Jacquelyn Mills
has lived over 40 years on this remote sliver of land in the Northwest      Editor
Atlantic Ocean. Shot on 16mm and created using a scope of innovative        Jacquelyn Mills
eco-friendly filmmaking techniques, this feature-length experimental        Print Source
documentary is a playful and reverent collaboration with the natural        Pascale Ramonde
world. Zoe leads us among wild horses, seals and bugs, through peaks,
valleys, roots, sands, weathers, seasons and stars.

‘I grew up in Nova Scotia and Sable Island is really well known here.
When I was really young, I remember seeing a news report about
this woman—Zoe Lucas—who lives on this mythical island and has
dedicated her life to studying and researching the flora and fauna
there. I remember as a young girl being totally captivated by that story;
it awoke something in me and stayed with me. It was the legend that
attracted me to her story but it was everything else—the details, the
hidden parts of that place—that really ignited this project and made
 it what it is.’ Director Jacquelyn Mills
