        LIFF 2022 Spotlights —
        Films Femmes Afrique:
        Women Creators of the Future
        LIFF 2022 is delighted to be collaborating with the
        Films Femmes Afrique Festival in Senegal to present
        a special programme of films by and about women
        from across Africa and the diaspora, supported
        by the British Council. Films Femmes Afrique held
        its 5th edition in March 2022 with the theme
        ‘Women Creators of the Future’, and we continue this
        celebration at LIFF this year with a selection
        of documentary and fiction titles that tell remarkable
        stories of African women. Many of the titles are
        debut features, highlighting the sheer talent of female
        filmmakers across the continent.
        The selection of films includes: Erige Sehiri’s acclaimed
        fiction debut Under The Fig Trees; Maryam Touzani
        returning to LIFF with her latest feature The Blue
        Caftan, in addition to her much loved debut Adam;
        and a special programme of shorts reflecting on what
        it means to call a place home.
        Special events include: the Afro-futurist musical
        Neptune Frost with a panel discussion on African
        cinema and cinephilia; the spellbinding documentary
        Above Water with a panel discussion on climate
        change, in partnership with Global Leeds; and Youth,
        the first feature film made in Djibouti, in partnership
        with Cinema Africa!.
