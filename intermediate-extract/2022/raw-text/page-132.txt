      London’s Forgotten                        In the misty streets of our capital, a wanderer
                                                drifts through an other-worldly narrative of the
      Print Source liamrogers00@hotmail.com     depressing and seemingly endless cycle of knife
                                                crime. The film is a poetic indictment of a system
                                                that allows the increasing and insidious effects
                                                of urban violence, on the forgotten victims, and
                                                those left to mourn.
