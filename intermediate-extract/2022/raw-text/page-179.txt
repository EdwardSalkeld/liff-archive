‘Honestly, community relations is key in Jamaica. …We hired a lot of        Paul Bucknor
the community to be extras, security and personal assistants and that       Print Source
is one way of avoiding conflict. When you give someone in these             Storm Saulter
communities something to do, they’re down because you’re giving
them pretty cool work and they feel like they’re part of the movement.
Because of that, a lot of people in the Sandy Park community, where
we mostly worked, are looking into film and working as personal
assistants in art departments, shooting their own videos because they
have been through the whole film with us.’ Director Storm Saulter,
from an interview with Fader
