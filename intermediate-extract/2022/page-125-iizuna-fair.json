  "description": "Hovering somewhere between a painting and a film, Iizuna Fair is a balm for the eyes. A piece originally commissioned by Nagano Art Museum, its central subject is a carnivalesque scene, an ever-changing profusion of faces and bodies, but with an eerie and beguiling quality of a James Ensor painting."
