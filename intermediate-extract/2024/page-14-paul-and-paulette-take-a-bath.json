    "description": "A young photographer and a woman with a taste for the macabre embark on a darkly comedic journey through France’s history with violence in this unique debut from Jethro Massey. Paul is a photographer who has given up his art for a soulless job. Paulette walks around Paris exploring its violent history. After the two meet on the spot of Marie Antoinette’s execution, an unusual relationship forms around a dark game - re-enacting crimes at the sites they occurred. Whilst Paul longs to get closer to Paulette, Paulette uses their trips to escape her past trauma. But as their morbid road trip approaches recent events, the game becomes more uncomfortable.",
