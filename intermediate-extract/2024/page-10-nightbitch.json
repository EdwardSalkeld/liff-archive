    "description": "This genre-bending exploration of motherhood and identity stars Amy Adams as a stay-at-home mum who becomes convinced she’s turning into a dog. A former artist in the big city, Mother has moved to the suburbs with her son while her husband travels the world with work. Feeling exhausted and struggling to connect with other parents in the neighbourhood, she starts to experience feral impulses inside her and a desire for liberation from her cage. Adapted from Rachel Yoder’s acclaimed 2021 novel, Marielle Heller’s fearless direction puts a fierce Adams at the forefront in a career-defining performance, that uniquely examines the dark aspects of motherhood we rarely discuss.",
