    "description": "Long-distance truck driver Patrick Quid is moving his cargo from Melbourne to Perth, over 2,000 miles to the west. On long, lonely stretches of road, on which one might encounter the same characters repeatedly, Quid becomes convinced that a serial killer is travelling alongside him. Director Richard Franklin was a sincere student of Alfred Hitchcock, and here he refits the suspenseful paranoia of Rear Window to Australia’s endless roads. This time the voyeur’s window is always in motion, never quite trusting what it sees.",
