    "description": "U Are the Universe is a captivating genre-bending journey touching the most universal aspects of life - love, loneliness, joy, sadness. Ukrainian filmmaker Pavlo Ostrikov’s debut feature follows Andriy on his space mission to transport nuclear waste from Earth to Jupiter’s moon Callisto, accompanied by a robot named Maxim to keep him company. Maxim has a joke for every occasion, which comes in handy when Earth explodes in the far distance and Andriy believes he is now the last living person in the universe - until a French woman named Catherine calls him from a faraway space station.",
