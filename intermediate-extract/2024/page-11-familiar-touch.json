    "description": "One of the highlights of this year's Venice Film Festival, Sarah\nFriedland's Familiar Touch won three top awards in the Horizons\nsection - Best Debut, Best Director, and Best Actress for Kathleen\nChalfant as Ruth. Familiar Touch is a refreshing, funny and very\nmoving coming of (old) age film about octogenarian Ruth and\nher transition to life in assisted living as she contends with her\nconflicting relationship to herself and her caregivers amidst her\nshifting memory, age identity, and desires. Ruth disavows not only\nthe roles expected of her - Mother, Patient, Old Lady - but also her\n'appropriate' age identity, sliding between feeling 85 and 25.",
