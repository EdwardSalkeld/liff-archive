    "description": "In 2012, conceptual artist Victoria Verseau underwent long-awaited gender-affirming surgery in Thailand. In this radically personal piece, she revisits the memories of that year, opening a metaphorical time capsule. After much anticipation for the surgery, then came feelings of uncertainty, amplified by the death of a close friend she met at the hospital. Through challenging conversations with friends awaiting their own operations, they openly discuss the need to reframe the idea of surgery as an end goal. Laying bare hidden wounds alongside intense joy, Verseau creates a brazenly beautiful debut film of loss, identity and hope.",
