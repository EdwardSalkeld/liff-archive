    "description": "Celebrating its 10th anniversary, LIFF’s Screendance competition spotlights international dance films that navigate the countless ways a moving body can drive a narrative: from the softness of a solo male negotiating his brutalist urban location to the eco-rage of a solo woman battling an underwater plastic-waste monster. Whether explicitly narrative or more abstract in perspective, these innovative shorts all share a particular engagement with choreography, offering an alternative take on this experimental form. A panel discussion with filmmakers will follow the screening on 8 November.",
