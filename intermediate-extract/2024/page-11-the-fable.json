    "description": "Raam Reddy's second feature is both a magical realist tale and an\nincisive political allegory, beautifully shot in 16mm in the Indian\nHimalayas. Dev owns a sprawling colonial style estate where he\nlives with his family. He tinkers in his shed to maintain human-sized\nwings, which he uses to soar over his woodlands and orchards.\nEverything is tranquil until one morning he finds a single burnt apple\ntree. Soon after, more trees are burnt and he engages his staff\nand the local police to investigate the mystery though it fuels local\ntensions and he begins to lose control.",
