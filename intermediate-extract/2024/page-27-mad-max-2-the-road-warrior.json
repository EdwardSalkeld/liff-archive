    "description": "The return of Max Rockatansky cemented director George Miller’s vision of bizarre, post-apocalyptic Australia, where people have peculiar names (‘Lord Humungus’, ‘The Toadie’), and everything is recycled from something else. Years after World War III, gasoline is the most valuable commodity and loner Max strikes a cold, hard bargain with a besieged community of settlers who strive to find a secret utopia. The Mad Max films have created a world all of their own, yet they still speak of a real outlaw spirit of the outback, places of speed, distance and scarcity.",
