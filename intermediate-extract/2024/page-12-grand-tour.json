    "description": "A beautiful Asian odyssey from Portuguese director Miguel Gomes, Grand Tour is an eccentric and playful story, combining period drama and contemporary documentary in a highly original style. In colonial Burma during the First World War, civil servant Edward abandons his fiancée Molly on their wedding day. Molly will not give up on her betrothal so easily and follows him doggedly across Asia. Drifting through China, Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam, the film shows the very different perspectives and adventures of the two characters, probing the influence of colonial history on the modern world.",
