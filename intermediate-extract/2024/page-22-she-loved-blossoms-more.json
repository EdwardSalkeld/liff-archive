    "description": "In an attempt to try and bring their mother back from the dead, three brothers are working on an unusual time machine in a dilapidated house. Pressured by their father and seemingly working against the clock, they skip a step or two with devastating consequences. Yannis Veslemes manages to balance humour and body horror perfectly, crafting a stunning sci-fi that’s visually unforgettable. With grief at its heart, She Loved Blossoms More feels like an acid-induced 90s fever dream that asks us to confront our relationship to loss and memory.",
