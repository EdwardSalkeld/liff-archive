    "description": "Co-created by a Palestinian-Israeli collective, No Other Land is a profound expression of creative resistance under brutal military occupation. Basel Adra is a young Palestinian activist from Masafer Yatta, a village in the occupied West Bank subjected to mass expulsion by the Israeli occupation since his childhood. Yuval, an Israeli journalist and fellow activist joins his struggle. Their bond is haunted by extreme inequality but together they work to find a path towards equality and justice. No Other Land is presented in partnership with the Leeds Palestinian Film Festival.",
