    "description": "In the first British Short Film Competition programme we explore themes of self-reflection, family and growth, with an eclectic and quintessentially British collection of shorts. We examine the complexities of parent-child relationships with Run Like We and Homework, then journeying through, and understanding lost recollections, with My Exploding House and Memory. Bathsheba takes a more introspective path, following a lost, grieving cello player, whilst we also take a look inwards with some light-hearted tales tackling sex and relationships in Talking Heads, or coming to terms with disability in Sleepyhead.",
