    "description": "A giant boar is marauding near a country town, killing and eating people. When an American journalist arrives to study the hunting of Australian wildlife for the pet food industry, she finds that people can be as threatening as wild animals. Razorback is a world in which city dwellers are mistrust ed by country folk, women don’t mix with men, and endless space creates claustrophobia. A very down-under take on Jaws which taps into Australian fears of the wild outback (the opening is a riff on the famous Azaria Chamberlain ‘dingo baby’ case), and renders them in high-end 1980s pop style.",
