    "description": "Gathering for what could be the last Christmas in their ancestral\nhome, four generations of the Balsano family intertwine, as\ntensions boil and relatives reconnect. Taormina's camera glides\nbetween the family members following no solid narrative;\nexploring the family web through the eyes of overexcited children,\nrebellious teenagers and bickering adults. At once charming\nand uncomfortable, Taormina masterfully captures the feelings\nof anticipation and disappointment of the festive season. With\nan ensemble cast of indie darlings including Michael Cera and\nFrancessca Scorcese, this debut is a rich and nostalgic gift and\na love letter to American suburbia.",
