    "description": "‘The Bush’ takes a cosmic revenge on a Sydney couple taking an ill-advised camping trip to the coast up north. Peter and Marcia have some unfinished business to resolve, and with Peter flagrantly careless around nature, the stage is set for a bloody showdown. An eagle, dugong, spider and (incongruously), a Tasmanian Devil all appear as hostile beasts in a kind of upside-down Bambi. Though it was, like many great Australian films, ignored at the time of release, this haunting ecological thriller embodies Australian terrors about an untamed interior, the unknowable entity that sits between the nation’s coastal cities, ready to wreak havoc.",
