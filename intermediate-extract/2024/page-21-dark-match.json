    "description": "A team of pro wrestlers accept a gig from a mysterious client played by Chris Jericho in this high-octane tribute to 80s wrestling from WolfCop director Lowell Dean. Miss Behave is a smalltime but ambitious wrestler trying to escape her villainous “heel” persona and navigate a growing relationship with veteran wrestler Joe (Stephen Ogg). However, when their sleazy manager strikes a shady deal for a private show in a backwater town with an interest in the occult, the team is plunged into a living nightmare where their wrestling skills are put to the ultimate test.",
