    "description": "A visually stunning masterpiece of the silent era, Alexander Dovzhenko’s Earth is a stirring paean to nature and rural life in Ukraine. Opening with lyrical shots of grain fields under a vast sky, the film transcends its origins as a propaganda piece on agricultural collectivization and evolves into a poetic meditation on nature’s cycle of life and death. This special screening is accompanied by live music from Ukrainian musicians Misha Kalinin (guitar) and Roksana Smirnova (piano), who have created a new jazz-based score, blending impressionistic soundscapes with improvisations that enhance Dovzhenko’s sweeping landscapes and iconic close-ups.",
