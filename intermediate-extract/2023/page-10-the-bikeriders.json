  "synopsis": "Inspired by the work of renowned photographer Danny Lyon, Jeff Nichols' engrossing drama follows the rise and fall of a 1960s rebel motorcycle gang. Beginning as a refuge for outsiders, the gang, led by the levelheaded Johnny (Tom Hardy), takes a violent turn as Johnny loses control and his brooding, unpredictable right-hand man Benny (Austin Butler) becomes distracted. Featuring a star performance by Jodie Comer as straight-talking outsider Kathy, who finds herself both horrified and enamoured with the gang, The Bikeriders is an effortless blend of comedy, violence and romanticism set against a backdrop of sprawling Midwest America.",
