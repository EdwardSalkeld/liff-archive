  "synopsis": "Blink and you might miss the unsettling and beguiling moments that shatter the malaise of modern life. Playful and satirical, these short films offer a searing commentary on a society and culture frequently devoid of morality. From underground raves to modern art exhibitions, we journey through the many facets of human nature. Through daily rituals, our hidden desires are exposed. We witness how empathy and compassion tussles against disparate and abusive power structures. Resistance can be challenging but these films never give up hope."
