  "synopsis": "Our Dutch Discoveries season at LIFF 2023 includes new films in Official Selection, classics in Rear View, and this short film programme. Featuring brilliant new animations, competition highlights and a previous LIFF favourite, the programme illuminates the breadth of film talent bursting from the Netherlands. Travel around the country as we encounter eccentric characters, discover the power of community, and consider the importance of taking pride in identity. An eclectic mix of styles and stories, our spotlight is a celebratory melting pot of creativity, much like the country it's focused on."
