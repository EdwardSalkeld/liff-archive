Witness an imaginary TV station filming anti-government sit-ins in Sudan, alongside a sensual snapshot of life with degenerative blindness. Listen to the melting glaciers of the Swiss Alps with sound artist Ludwig Berger, and hear the powerful story of a women's exclusion amid the mountains of Afghanistan. Ponder the ironies of global tourism and the curiosities of crop circles, and finally, as a magical moon creeps in, let intertwined tales and timelines wash over you in mysterious Manzanillo, Costa Rica."
