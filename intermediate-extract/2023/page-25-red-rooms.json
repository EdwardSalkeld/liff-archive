  "synopsis": "Pascal Plante's Red Rooms - winner of best film at this year's Fantasia film festival - is an unsettling and unflinching look into the often exploitative world of true crime content and the sinister mysteries of the dark web. Kelly-Anne (Juliette Gari\u00e9py) and Clementine (Laurie Babin) are two women obsessed with suspected serial killer Ludovic Chevalier (Maxwell McCabe-Lokos) who is on trial for filming and distributing his torture and murder of three teenage girls in live-streamed 'red rooms'. Sharp, sleek cinematography and chilling sound design make Red Rooms a must-see for those who like their drama dark and disturbing.",
