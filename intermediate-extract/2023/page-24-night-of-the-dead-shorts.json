  "synopsis": "No matter your flavour of fear, there's something for everyone in our Night of the Dead short film selection which will be presented throughout the night among the features. A social worker discovers a mysterious manhole in the home of two children, toilet humour turns terrifying when somebody refuses to flush and a stroll through the woods quickly turns bloody. Meanwhile, a couple of new parents' worst nightmares comes true, the future of social media has never been darker, and we see just how far a mother would go to save her son."
