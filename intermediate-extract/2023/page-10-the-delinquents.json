  "synopsis": "An inventive and captivating take on the heist genre from Argentine director Rodrigo Moreno. Bank clerk Moran (Daniel Elias) plots the perfect crime - to embezzle enough money to never work again, enlist his colleague Roman (Esteban Bigliardi) to hide the loot, serve a prison sentence, and then retrieve his hidden stash. Drawing inspiration from a classic Argentinian noir, Hugo Fregonese's Hardly a Criminal (1949), The Delinquents takes the original source material and expands it into something wholly original and enthralling. This stylish, slow-burn crime drama is a standout from this year's Cannes film festival.",
