  "synopsis": "'Coconut Head Generation' is a scornful expression for a stubborn and empty-headed youth, transformed by Alain Kassanda's patiently observed documentary. Every Thursday, a group of students from the University of Ibadan, the oldest in Nigeria, organises a movie club, transforming a small lecture hall into a political agora where the viewer's gaze is sharpened and a critical mind is developed. The film elegantly questions assumptions and encourages debate and freedom of thought. Screening with a panel on film and education presented in partnership with the University of Leeds.",
