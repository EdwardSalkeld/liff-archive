Anyone who dies an unnatural death has the right to be brought back to life, as long as you create a backup of your personality - a restore point - at least every 48 hours. But there is an underground movement that wants to sabotage this right. Agent Em finds herself drawn into a case that is not as simple as it first seemed and its consequences are far reaching. Robert Hloz's first feature film is a captivating futuristic crime thriller and an exciting new addition to ambitious European sci-fi filmmaking.",
