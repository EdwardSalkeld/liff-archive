  "synopsis": "A compelling and intimate look at the daily lives of taxi drivers in Peru from Dutch documentary maker Heddy Honigmann. Filmed almost entirely from inside the taxis, Honigmann lets conversations unfold naturally, as drivers reveal candid thoughts and share personal stories. Highlighting the harsh economic realities of Peru in the early 1990s, many middle-class professionals like doctors and civil servants took taxi driving as a second job. A deeply loving and unique portrait of the people of Honigmann's former hometown of Lima, this documentary road movie shines a light on their dreams, challenges and creative resilience.",
