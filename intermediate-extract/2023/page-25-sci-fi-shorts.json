  "synopsis": "In this year's sci-fi selection, we follow a lone probe as it collects music amongst the infinite fields of sounds, a woman is thwarted by captcha technology and a snow creature tries to protect the last natural ice left in the world. Elsewhere, a man ducks out of ending a relationship by recruiting a clone replacement, meanwhile, a couple instead grapple with rapidly multiplying clones of themselves. And finally, we look to the skies, as a NASA scientist bonds with his son over an accidental discovery and two prisoners share a cell in space."
