  "synopsis": "Growing up is hard to do, as the protagonists in this selection of films discover. Across these stories - which include a winner at SXSW and a short screened at Cannes Directors Fortnight - the mysteries of the world are slowly revealed in a variety of intelligent and intriguing ways. Capturing the essence of childhood - the fears, the anxiety but also the playfulness and the sense of joy - these shorts give us a chance to look at the world from a child's perspective and to experience the energy of youthful exuberance."
