  "synopsis": "You sleep, you die. That's the premise of Irish director Ian Hunt-Duffy's confident debut feature, Double Blind. Cash-strapped and desperate, Claire (Millie Brady) has volunteered to take part in a five-day experiment for the mysterious Blackwood Pharmaceuticals. She is one of seven healthy participants undergoing clinical trials in a mysteriously underpopulated facility, where no contact with the outside world is permitted. But when the drug trial goes horribly wrong, the surviving test subjects must fight off sleep, and each other, to stay alive, in this twisted single location horror.",
