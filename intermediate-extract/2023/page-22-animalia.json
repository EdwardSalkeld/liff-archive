  "synopsis": "Heavily pregnant Itto, a young woman from a modest rural background, is slowly adapting to the Moroccan privileged codes of her husband's family. But when a mysterious state of emergency is declared nationwide, Itto finds herself alone. Meanwhile, increasingly ominous events and strange weather phenomena suggest a supernatural presence is nearing. Sofia Alaoui's first feature film is an original and visually hypnotic sci-fi that explores the tension between faith and purpose, eroding myths and challenging class prejudice to expose how we are more connected than we know.",
