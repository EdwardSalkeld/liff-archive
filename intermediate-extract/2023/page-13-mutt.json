  "synopsis": "This accomplished feature debut by Vuk Lungulov-Klotz is an intimate and honest exploration of post-transition life. Fena (Lio Mehiel) is a young trans man living in New York, navigating his way through a fraught and emotional 24 hours, as an ex-boyfriend, a little sister, and an estranged dad all reappear in his life. Mehiel gives a sublime performance, bringing warmth, courage and vulnerability to the role. Drawing on aspects of his own life and experiences, director/writer Lungulov-Klotz has crafted a tender, frank and urgent work of trans cinema, and one of this year's must-see films.",
