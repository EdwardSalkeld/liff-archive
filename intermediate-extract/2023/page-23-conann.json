  "synopsis": "Travelling through the abyss, underworld dog Rainer (Elina Lowensohn) recounts the six lives of Conann, a fierce shape shifter who is perpetually put to death by her own future, across eras, myths and ages. We see her childhood, her time as slave to a barbarian horde and her accession to the summits of cruelty at the doors of our world. A transgressive masterpiece in the making, Conann is a blood-soaked and queer-edged chaos epic of reinvention and resurrection. A feast for the eyes, but not for the faint of heart (or stomach), Conann will devour you whole.",
