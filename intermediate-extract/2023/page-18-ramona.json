  "synopsis": "Premiering at Berlinale 2023, Ramona is a genre-bending exploration of class, motherhood and the power of community which blurs the lines between fiction and documentary. Camila has been cast as Ramona, a pregnant teenager from the outskirts of Santo Domingo. From a more affluent background, Camila feels uncomfortable with the role, so journeys to interview real young mothers from the area to understand their experiences. What begins as a behind-the-scenes making of a film, soon transforms into an exploration of the complexities of teenage pregnancy, as each girl candidly shares her story and takes on the role of Ramona.",
