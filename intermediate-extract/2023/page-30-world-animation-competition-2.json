  "synopsis": "We present ten more exciting new films from around the world in our second World Animation programme, packed with absorbing dreamscapes, poetic fables, oddball docu-fictions and intimate miniature worlds. We welcome back to the competition Sonja Rohleder, a German animator whose colourful new film Somni describes a magical journey into sleep, and Ivana Bosnjak and Thomas Johnson, who spin another fascinating Croatian yarn using sugar sachets and plush galloping horses in Remember How I Used to Ride a White Horse."
