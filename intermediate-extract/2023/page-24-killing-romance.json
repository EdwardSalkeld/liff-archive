  "synopsis": "The first film of its kind from South Korea where it became a cult hit, Killing Romance is a musical comic fantasia that has surprised and delighted audiences at film festival previews in the USA and Canada. Former superstar actress Hwang Yeo-Rae is trapped in a toxic marriage with egomaniacal, obscenely wealthy tycoon Jonathan Na. Teaming up with her young fanboy neighbour Kim Beom-Woo, they scheme together to break her free. Farce, thrills, and quick bursts of K-pop-inspired tunes ensue as their scheming keeps failing, and everything escalates to a grand finale of bizarreness.",
