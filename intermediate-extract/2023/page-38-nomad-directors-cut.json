  "synopsis": "A beautiful new restoration brings this vibrant youth picture fully to life. Two pairs of friends - rich Louis and Kathy, poorer Tomato and Pong - meet and hang out with little on their minds except what's right there: a slightly vapid city life full of high-jinks. And no politics, or that is until Kathy's old boyfriend Shinsuke appears, fresh from deserting Japan's militant communist Red Army. We're taken through wild, beguiling shifts of tone in Nomad; comedy-to-sex-to-introspection-to-violence. An indelible as a 'New Wave' movie, and a thrilling ode to a disappeared Hong Kong.",
