  "synopsis": "The second of two free breakfast screenings at LIFF 2023 (Before Sunrise screens on 4 November), this zany and anarchic comedy from Louis Malle is sure to help you wake up. In this most freewheeling of French New Wave films and Malle's first in dazzling colour, precocious ten-year-old Zazie (Catherine Demongeot) comes to Paris for a whirlwind weekend with her rakish uncle (Philippe Noiret) and discovers that the Metro is closed due to a strike. But that's no obstacle to having fun for Zazie as she sets out on a madcap adventure around the streets and sights of the City of Light.",
