  "synopsis": "Bucky Le Boeuf is a budding filmmaker who loves arthouse cinema and hates blood. So when a horror film competition comes to town he is understandably cynical, until the combination of a huge cash prize, a chance to work with his favourite director and an alien meteorite turning his Dad into a flesh-hungry zombie soon change his mind. Seeing his chance to make it big, he decides to create the most realistic zombie movie ever made in this outrageously entertaining, blood soaked zom-com from debut filmmaker Cooper Roberts."
