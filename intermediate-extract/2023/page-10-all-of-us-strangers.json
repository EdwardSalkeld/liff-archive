  "synopsis": "The latest film from Andrew Haigh (Weekend, 45 Years) is a sensual melodrama about love and loss with inventive touches of magical realism and a killer 80s synth pop soundtrack. Grounded by two great performances from its leads, Andrew Scott plays Adam, a depressed screenwriter who encounters a mysterious neighbour (Paul Mescal), which breaks him out of a rut. As a relationship develops, Adam is preoccupied with memories of the past and returns to his childhood home where his parents appear to be living as they were on the day they died, 30 years before.",
