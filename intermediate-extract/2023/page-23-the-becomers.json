  "synopsis": "A genre-bending highlight of this year's Fanomenon, The Becomers blends sci-fi, horror, road movie, comedy, melodrama and romance in a tale of two body-swapping aliens who come to Earth and try to find their way in a divided modern America. Kitsch-soaked and Star-Trek-inspired, featuring apt lo-fi special effects and a narration by Sparks legend Russell Mael, The Becomers is about love, longing, alienation, and the state of our planet. The latest film from long-admired American indie filmmaker Zach Clark, The Becomers has its UK Premiere at LIFF 2023.",
