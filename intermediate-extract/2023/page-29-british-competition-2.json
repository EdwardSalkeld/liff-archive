  "synopsis": "Our second British Short Film Competition is an exciting celebration of characters defying convention and finding their own stories, style, and purpose, through passionate filmmaking and the exploration of new and exciting ideas. From the anthropomorphised depiction of salmon fighting for their own existence and survival in the mesmerising yet haunting Wild Summon, to the ultimate fight for life from the grave and beyond, for a lovable rogue in the fantastical black comedy, Meeting Mr Samuel, these characters defy expectations and hopefully inspire the audience along the way."
