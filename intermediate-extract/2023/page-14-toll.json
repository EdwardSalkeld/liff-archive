  "synopsis": "Carolina Markowicz's vibrant and beguiling comedy drama, Toll takes on the disturbing trends of homophobia in contemporary Brazil with great wit and flair. Single mother Suellen works as a toll booth attendant in an industrial area outside Sao Paulo. She is increasingly exasperated by her teenaged son Antonio, who likes to make campy online videos dressed in sequins. She hatches a plan to use her job to raise some extra money illegally. But this is only for what she believes is a noble cause: to send her son to an expensive gay conversion workshop led by a renowned foreign priest.",
