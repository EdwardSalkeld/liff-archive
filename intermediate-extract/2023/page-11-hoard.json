  "synopsis": "It's 1984, and 7-year-old Maria lives with her loving and eccentric mother in a house rapidly filling with piles of rubbish. Through creative production design, we share young Maria's vision of their home as both a magical safe haven and a nightmarish world of visceral decay. After their unstable environment falls apart, we find teenage Maria living in a more conventional home. When events destabilise her sense of safety, trauma resurfaces in unpredictable ways through a wild and combustible affair with a young man at her foster home. Fearless and uncompromising, Hoard confirms Luna Carmoon as an exciting new talent and a singular voice in British cinema.",
