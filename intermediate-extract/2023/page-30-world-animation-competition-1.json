  "synopsis": "Animation is a beautiful endeavour, where diverse artistry, craft, passion and unique visions combine, to create a film format that - to our minds - remains unsurpassed. This year's Academy Award-qualifying World Animation Competition once again offers fantastic examples of brand new animated shorts for LIFF audiences to enjoy. From the painterly forms of Jenny Jokela's Sweet like Lemons or the delicate drawings of dangerous children in La Saison pourpre, to the odd, watery moving statues of Such Miracles Do Happen and the galactic majesty of Neeraj Bhattacharjee's Record. Play. Stop."
