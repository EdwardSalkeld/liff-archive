  "synopsis": "Our popular horror shorts selection returns and includes the last recorded footage of a murdered couple on Dartmoor, a formidable female gang in France named the 'Wolves' and a woman who has started to date a poltergeist. Meanwhile, we'll also discover the terrifying rituals of a rural Welsh community, as well as the murderous gnome creatures that can be encountered on your daily run. To close the programme, we'll meet a woman hiding a mysterious growth and attend a feast catered by a magical fridge."
