  "synopsis": "Begotten is a legendary cult film by director E. Elias Merhige that really is unlike any other film in history. The Begotten Cycle collects the 1989 feature with the later short films Din of Celestial Birds and Polia and Blastema, all shot on reversal 16mm black and white film and elaborately processed using homemade optical printers. The films are inspired by creation myths and cosmology, an abstract celestial history from supernova to forest floor, it plunges spectators into a surrealistic and sometimes horrific world of profane and sacred rituals. Begotten is the dead sea scrolls of Midnight Movies.",
