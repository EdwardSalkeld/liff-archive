  "synopsis": "Teenage vampire Sasha has a problem: she's too empathetic to kill. After her parents cut off her blood supply, forcing her to murder for herself, Sasha's life is in danger. After encountering suicidal boy Paul, seeing an opportunity to kill two birds with one stone, Paul offers himself as Sasha's first meal which would be great, if she wasn't developing feelings for him. Winner of the 2023 Giornate degli Autori Director's Award at Venice, Ariane Louis-Seize's debut feature is a stylish deadpan comedy about teen love that is sure to delight fans of What We Do In The Shadows.",
