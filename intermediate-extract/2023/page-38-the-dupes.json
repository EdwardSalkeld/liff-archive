  "synopsis": "In 1950s Iraq, three Palestinian refugees attempt to cross the border into Kuwait in hope of a better future. Adapted from the 1962 novella 'Men in the Sun' by Palestinian writer and resistance leader Ghassan Kanafani, the tense human drama of their high-risk journey across the desert serves as an allegory to the Palestinian struggle as a whole. Powerful and uncompromising, this masterpiece of Arab cinema shot in stark black and white leaves an indelible mark on the viewer. This special screening is presented in collaboration with Leeds Palestinian Film Festival.",
