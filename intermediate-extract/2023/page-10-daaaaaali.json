  "synopsis": "French absurdist master Quentin Dupieux (Deerskin, Smoking Causes Coughing) is the perfect director for this spirited tribute to notorious surrealist Salvador Dali. Daaaaaali! is a playful and often hilarious mockumentary with a labyrinthine plot involving overlapping dream sequences, unpredictable leaps in time and no less than five different actors portraying the artist. A nervous pharmacist turned journalist (played by Dupieux regular Anais Demoustier) has to keep coming up with ever more elaborate ruses to get a promised interview with Dali, who in turn makes ever more outrageous demands. Everything is a performance and nothing is quite what it seems.",
