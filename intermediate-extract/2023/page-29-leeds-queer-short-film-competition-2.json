  "synopsis": "Since 2018, Leeds Queer Film Festival has proudly curated the Queer Short Film Competition for LIFF. This second programme brings to the screen a range of unique LGBTQ+ experiences: the connection between a trans artist and a trans life drawing model, a disabled young woman looking for her first sexual experience, and the drama that can ensue when you come out to your wife in your local corner shop. Plus a little motivation to clean your room, from an unexpected but very effective source."
