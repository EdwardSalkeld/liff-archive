  "synopsis": "Tara, Sky and Em head to Malia on a rite-of-passage holiday of sun, sex and no suspicious parents. Set against a backdrop of neon lights and pounding house music, Tara's quest to lose her virginity heats up as things progress with Paddy, an oily Mancunian from the flat next door. But what should be the best summer of their lives takes a dark turn when Tara's first time leaves her confused and detached. Molly Manning Walker's gritty debut is a vital exploration of the nuances of consent and the societal pressures imposed on teenagers.",
