  "synopsis": "Inside the Yellow Cocoon Shell is a mesmerising spiritual road movie haunted by the beautiful landscapes of rural Vietnam. The film begins in lively, chaotic Saigon as the brooding Thien witnesses a fatal motorcycle accident. His sister in law is one of the victims and Thien is tasked with childcare duties for his 5-year-old nephew Dao. The pair gradually form an awkward alliance as they head deep into the countryside in search of the boy's father. Director Pham Thien crafts a richly cinematic, multi-layered sensory experience and a moving meditation on loss and grief.",
