  "synopsis": "Kleber Mendonca Filho pays homage to the lost cinemas of his hometown, Recife, in this poetic and personal documentary. As narrator, Filho first guides us through his family home, a place that holds significant memories, and a cinematic space that functioned as the setting for several of his films. We then travel to downtown Recife, as Filho reflects on the city's grand picture palaces. Poignant and playful, Filho's film is a heartfelt love letter to the cinemas and city that shaped him. This screening will be followed by a panel on cinema futures, discussing the effects of streaming platforms in national and international contexts.",
